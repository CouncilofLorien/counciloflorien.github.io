The ***Council of Lórien*** is the official U.S. sanctioning body for the _Middle-earth collectible card game_. The Council of Lórien was operated by Iron Crown Enterprises between 1996 and 1999. The _Council of Laurelindórenan Lindelorendor Malinornélion Ornemalin_ is held by the ents of the U.S. _Middle-earth_ playersgroup. They meet in the valley where the trees in a golden light sing musically, a land of music and dreams; there are yellow trees there, it is a tree-yellow land.

The ***Counsel of Lórien*** is the chief archivist.
