Scenarios
The King beneath the Mountains
"'The mountain throne once more is freed!
O! wandering folk, the summons heed!
Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!
The king of friend and kin has need.'"
-The Hobbit
With the unexpected fall of the dragon Smaug, Thorin Oakenshield became King under the Mountain. He sent messages to all his folk calling upon them for aid, as his need was great. Yet his kin were few and scattered. Only some might quickly reach him, but all would be needed in time, if Lonely Mountain were again to be made fair.

You are a Dwarf lord gathering a host of companions to your side. Who will marshal the most useful force and gain the favor of the King under the Mountain? Will you be the one to sit at the King's side or will another take your place?

Victory Conditions
Once you have exhausted your play deck once, you may bid for a victory at the end of any turn if you have 22 marshalling points and five or more Dwarf characters in play. At this point, each of your characters makes a corruption check outside of the turn sequence. If you still have at least 18 marshalling points after these checks, the Lonely Mountain achieves a grandeur unrivalled, and you win automatically. Only marshalling points from Dwarven factions, Dwarf characters, items, and dead creatures count. Marshalling points for Dwarven factions are doubled if you control both the Iron Hill Dwarves and the Blue Mountain Dwarves.

During tournament play, you bring bands of stout Dwarves to aid Thorn Oakenshield in cleansing the dragon's lair (achieve rank 1) when you accumulate 10 marshalling points. You draw companies of brave Dwarves to help the King make the Lonely Mountain home to his kindred (rank 2) when you accumulate 14 marshalling points. You attract swarms of honorable Dwarves to make the mountain halls fair (achieve rank 3) when you accumulate 18 marshalling points. You summon hosts of loyal Dwarves to create splendor under the mountain (achieve rank 4) when you accumulate 21 marshalling points.
