# THE CARDS AND DECKS

 There  are  five  types of cards: site cards, character cards, resource  cards, hazard  cards,  and region cards (this last type is not used  with  the  Starter Rules). Your cards are organized into two decks and three piles:

* Location  Deck  -  This deck consists of your site cards. You  may  examine  and select  cards  from  your  location deck as required  by  play  (i.e.,  do  not randomly  draw  them).  Your non-Haven site cards are sometimes  discarded  and placed in the discard pile.

* Play  Deck  -  This  deck consists of your resource cards,  hazards  cards,  and character cards. You randomly draw cards from this deck during play. Your  play deck starts with an equal mix of resource cards and hazard cards. You  can  use resources at certain sites and in certain conditions.  Resources include:  items,  factions, allies, events, etc. You  may  only  play  resource cards  during  your  own  turn.  You use hazards  to  hinder  and  attack  your opponent's  characters in order to prevent them from marshaling resources. You may only play hazard cards during your opponent's movement/hazard phase.
 
 * Discard Pile - Your discarded cards are placed face down in your discard  pile. When your play deck is exhausted, the location cards in your discard pile  are returned  to the location deck and you shuffle the play cards and they become your new play deck.

  Note:  Your play deck is "exhausted" when you draw its last card. Some cards require  that  your  play deck be manipulated and then reshuffled-this does not "exhaust" your play deck.
  
 * Out-of-play Pile - Your cards that are removed from play after being  used  are placed in your out-of-play pile.
 * Marshaling  Point  Pile (MP pile) - When certain cards are removed  from  play, you  gain  marshaling  points. When you defeat  all  of  the  strikes  from  a creature,  the  creature's card is placed in your  MP  pile.  When  you  store certain  resource  cards  (e.g., items, information  cards,  etc.),  they  are placed in your MP pile.
  
### Card Position
 Normally,  during play, each of your cards is placed on the playing surface  so that its top is towards your opponent and its bottom is towards you. During play certain  cards  must  be "tapped" when they are used-this is  a  record  keeping mechanism to keep track of card usage. To tap a card, rotate it 90_ so  that  it is turned sideways-to untap a card, rotate it back 90_ to its normal position.

 When  one  of  your  characters is wounded, his card is  placed  with  its  top towards  you.  All  restrictions  to tapped characters  also  apply  to  wounded characters.

### Unique & "May Not Be Duplicated" Cards  
If  a  card states that it is "unique" or that it "may not be duplicated," only one  such card (or its effects) may be in play at a time. The first card  played takes precedence (influence checks may change this).
                                       
 Because  hazard cards are distinct from resource cards, you may not  play  your hazards  on your side of the playing surface. At the end of a game, it  will  be obvious  whose cards are whose, i.e., hazards in your area must belong  to  your opponent. We suggest adopting a neutral zone between each player's side  of  the playing surface. Non-targeted long-events and permanent-events can be played  in this neutral zone.
