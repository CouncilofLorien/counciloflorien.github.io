 Combat  occurs when a creature hazard is played on a company or when a  company
at  a  site with an automatic-attack attempts to play a resource card  for  that
site or when any other card indicates that a company must face an attack.
 An  attack consists of one or more of strikes. Each strike can target  one  and
only one character in the attacked company, and each character can be the target
of  only one strike from a given attack. Unless the attack states otherwise, the
defender chooses which untapped characters will be the targets of given strikes.
Then,  the attacker chooses which other defending characters not yet assigned  a
strike will be the target of any remaining unassigned strikes.
Strike Modifications
 If  an  attack  has more strikes than the company has characters, the  attacker
may allocate the excess strikes as -1 modifications (i.e., a -1 modification for
each unallocated strike) to the prowesses of whichever target(s) he chooses.
 Each  unwounded, tapped character must modify his prowess by -1.  Each  wounded
character must modify his prowess by -2.
 Normally a character that is the target of a strike is tapped after the  strike
is  resolved. However, a character that is the target of a strike may choose  to
take  a -3 modification to his prowess. If so, the character is not tapped after
the strike is resolved (he is still tapped if he is wounded).
 The  target's prowess may also be modified due to the play of certain  resource
and hazard cards. Only one resource card requiring skill may be played against a
given strike.
 ConditionModification to Target's Prowess
 Unwounded, tapped character            -1
 Wounded character                      -2
 For each unused strike allocated (i.e., each extra strike)  -1
 Untapped character decides not to tap  -3
 Up to one resource card that requires skill  varies
 Other resource cards               varies
 Hazard cards                       varies
Resolving Strikes
 Strikes  are  resolved one at a time as decided by the defending  player.  When
you  choose  a  strike  to resolve, determine all of the factors  affecting  the
strike before the roll is made.
 To  resolve  a  strike, the defender makes a roll (2D6) and adds  his  modified
prowess:
 If  the modified result is greater than the strike's prowess, the strike fails.
 Such  a  strike is defeated if its body attribute is "-"  or  if it has a  body
 attribute and fails a body check.
 If  the  modified  result  is equal to the strike's  prowess,  the  strike  was
 ineffectual (i.e., a "tie" means that the strike is avoided but not defeated).
 Otherwise,  the  strike was successful (i.e., the character was defeated).  The
 target character is wounded and must make a body check.
Body Checks
 If  a  strike  against a character is successful, the character is wounded  and
must  make a body check. To make a body check, the attacker makes a roll  (2D6);
if  this value is greater than the character's body attribute, the character  is
eliminated. If the character was already wounded before this strike, the  result
is modified
by +1.
 As  presented  above, a strike that fails is defeated if its body attribute  is
"-"  or  if it has a body attribute and fails a body check. To make such a  body
check,  the  defender  makes a roll (2D6); if this value  is  greater  than  the
strike's body attribute, the strike is defeated.
Defeating an Attack
 An  attack  by  a  hazard creature is defeated if all of its  strikes  directed
against a company are defeated. If a defeated attack is a hazard creature, it is
placed  in the defender's marshaling point pile. The defender receives  MPs  for
eliminating it.
Sequencing Strikes
 You  and  your opponent must play any cards that modify the number  of  strikes
before you assign the strikes.
 Strikes  are  resolved one at a time as decided by the defending player  (i.e.,
he  chooses  a  strike to resolve, the strike is resolved, he chooses  the  next
strike  to  resolve, the strike is resolved, etc.). All of the factors affecting
the  strike must be decided before making the roll (2D6). Address these  factors
in the following order:
1) The attacker may play hazard cards that affect the strike (these count toward
 the hazard limit against this company).
2) The attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining (if any) -1
 modifications due to unallocated strikes (i.e., strikes in excess of the
 company's size).
3) A target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not
 automatically tap.
4) The defending player may play resource cards that affect the strike (up to
 one card that requires skill).
Defeating an Attack
 If  a hazard creature has multiple attacks, each must be defeated in order  for
the defender to receive the MPs.
 If  one  of  the  strikes  was  cancelled or ineffectual,  the  attack  is  not
defeated.  If the attack is cancelled, the attack is not defeated.  A  cancelled
attack has no effect on the defending company.
                                       
Example of Combat [(#/#) means (prowess/body)]
 You  control  Bilbo  (1/9),  Balin (4/7) and his  follower  Bofur  (4/7)  (with
Healing  Herbs), Beretar (5/8), and Beregond (4/8) (with an Elven  Cloak).  They
are  en  route from Rivendell to L˘rien. There are 4.5 characters in the company
which rounds up to 5, meaning the hazard limit is 5.
 Your  opponent plays Orc-raiders. He keys this hazard creature to  the  border-
land of your company's site path because he is mindful of Beregond's Elven Cloak
(a  minor item that cancels a strike keyed to wilderness). Bilbo, a scout,  taps
and plays Concealment to cancel the attack. That's 1 hazard down and potentially
4 to go.
 Your opponent next plays Orc-warband (second hazard) and states it is keyed  to
the border-land. It's a (4/-) hazard creature with 5 strikes that receives +3 to
prowess  against  a  company  that has faced an orc attack.  Even  though  Bilbo
cancelled  the Orc-raiders, the company is still considered to have faced  them,
so the Orc-warband will be
(7/-).  There  are 5 strikes and 5 characters, so each character will  face  one
strike (no decisions on strike allocation can be made). Bilbo elects to face his
strike first. His opponent plays Weariness of the Heart (third hazard) on  Bilbo
to  give  -1 to his prowess. This modification to his prowess is in addition  to
the -1 Bilbo suffers for being tapped. No other effects are played to affect the
strike  and Bilbo rolls the dice. The result is a 5. Bilbo's prowess of -1  plus
the  dice  roll  is  less than the prowess of the Orc-warband's  strike  against
Bilbo, so Bilbo is wounded (inverted on the table). Your opponent rolls the body
check. It's a 7-Bilbo lives!
 Beregond  faces  the next strike. Beregond taps and rolls a 10,  defeating  his
strike handily. Bofur chooses to face his strike next. He chooses not to tap and
to  therefore take a -3 modification to his prowess. He rolls a 6 which ties the
prowess of the Orc-warband strike. The strike is ineffectual.
 Balin  resolves his strike next, taps, and defeats it by rolling a  7.  Beretar
resolves the final strike, taps, and defeats it by rolling a 3.
 Your opponent sees that one character, Bofur, is untapped. He plays Giant (13/-
)  (a  fourth  hazard) and reasons that Bofur will have to take its one  vicious
strike.  (After all, if you give up the option of assigning the  one  strike  to
your  untapped character, namely Bofur, the opponent will be able to choose from
all  5  characters which will take the strike). Your opponent does not see  what
Bofur  sees. Before assigning the strike, Bofur taps and uses his Healing  Herbs
to  untap  Beregond, who then announces he is taking the strike.  The  Giant  is
keyed  solely to double wilderness, so Beregond taps his Elven Cloak  to  cancel
its single strike.
 The opponent announces he will play no more hazards and the company breathes  a
sigh  of relief. Bilbo will be able to heal at the start of the next turn  since
his company will be in L˘rien, a Haven.
8  CORRUPTION
 Each  character has a corruption point total. This starts at zero, but  certain
cards  and  activities will increase and decrease this total during  play.  Most
cards  that affect a character's corruption are kept under the character's  card
until  they  are discarded. Only one corruption card may be played  on  a  given
character each turn.
Corruption Checks
 When  a  card  indicates  that one of your characters must  make  a  corruption
check, you must make a roll (2D6) and add any appropriate modifications:
  If  the  modified  result  is  greater than the character's  corruption  point
  total, nothing happens.
  If  the modified result is equal to the character's corruption point total  or
  one  less  than the character's corruption point total, you must  discard  the
  character along with any non-follower cards he controls. In this case, if  the
  character is a Wizard, you immediately lose the game.
  Otherwise,  the character is eliminated and you must discard any  non-follower
  cards  he  controls.  In  this  case,  if  the  character  is  a  Wizard,  you
  immediately lose the game.
                                       
 As  characters adventure in Middle-earth, they are subject to temptations. They
run  the  risk  of becoming corrupted and leaving the cause of the Free  Peoples
(i.e., a corrupted character leaves play, a corrupted Wizard loses the game). In
The Lord of the Rings, Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast was corrupted by
the  lure of nature, Alatar and Pallando succumbed to unrevealed corruptions and
disappeared into the East.
 A  character's corruption point total can be determined at any time by  summing
the  corruption  point values of the corruption cards under  his  card.  Certain
characters  receive modifications to corruptions checks, and certain  cards  may
give modifications to a corruption check. Modifications to corruption checks are
printed  in  the  lower right of the appropriate card. A plus or  a  minus  sign
indicates a modification rather than corruption points.

 An  untapped character that is not the target of a strike may tap to support  a
character  in  the  same company that is the target of a  strike.  The  target's
prowess is modified by +1 for each supporting character.
