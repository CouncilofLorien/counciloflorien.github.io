 In  METW  the  lands of northwest Middle-earth are represented by regions.  The
site cards represent places that characters can visit within those regions. Each
company has a site card associated with it-the company is located at that  site.
Starting characters are brought into play at the Rivendell site.
 There are six types of regions and six types of sites:
 Region Type Symbol  Site Type   Symbol
 Coastal Seas   [c]  Havens       [ h ]
 Free-domains   [f]  Free-holds   [ F ]
 Border-lands   [b]  Border-holds [ B ]
 Wilderness     [w]  Ruins & Lairs[ r ]
 Shadow-lands   [s]  Shadow-holds [ S ]
 Dark-domains   [d]  Dark-holds   [ D ]
 Each  company moves by playing a new site card (face down). A company does  not
have to move during a given turn.
 If  the  company's current site is a Haven, the new site card  must  list  that
Haven  as its nearest Haven. If the company's current site is a non-haven  site,
the  new  site card must be the Haven listed as the nearest haven on the current
site card.
 Suggestion: To help decide where a company should move, look at the  resource
 cards in your hand. Then decide to which of your available sites to move.
 A  site  path is the sequence of regions between a site and the nearest  Haven.
However, each region in the sequence is only indicated by its type, not  by  its
name.  Each non-Haven site card has a site path on it. Each Haven site card  has
two  site  paths,  but  each of those two paths gives the  sequence  of  regions
between the Haven and one of the two Havens nearest to it.
 Example:  The  Lonely Mountain site's nearest Haven is the L˘rien  site.  The
 regions  between  these two sites are Wold & Foothills  (Wilderness),  Anduin
 Vales  (Wilderness),  Woodland Realm (Border-land),  and  Northern  Rhovanion
 (Wilderness).  The symbol for Wilderness is w,the symbol for  Border-land  is
 b. So the site path between L˘rien and the Lonely Mountain is:
                                     w w b w
 By  using  site  paths, a company can move from any site  to  any  other  site.
First,  if  neccessary,  the  company moves  to  the  nearest  Haven.  Then,  if
neccessary, it moves to another Haven. Finally, it moves from that Haven to  the
destination site.
Region Types
Coastal Seas [ c ]: A region consisting largely of open water.
Free-domains [ f ]: Very safe, civilized regions (e.g., Lindon, An˘rien, etc.).
Border-lands [ b ]: Less civilized regions on the border of the wilderness or
 shadow territory (e.g., Rohan, Lamedon, etc.).
Wilderness [ w ]: Sparsely populated, uncivilized regions that cover most of NW
 Middle-earth (e.g., High Pass, Enedhwaith, Rhudaur, etc.).
Shadow-lands [ s ]: Regions with some active Shadow-forces
 and settlements (Imlad Morgul, Dagorlad, etc.).
Dark-domains [ d ]: A region with a heavy concentration of Shadow-forces
 (Southern Mirkwood, Gorgoroth, etc.).
Site Types
Havens [ h ]: Very safe sites of rest and healing
 (e.g., Rivendell, Grey Havens, Edhellond, and L˘rien).
Free-holds [ F ]: Sites of safety, but still dangerous due to
 assassins, traitors, etc. (e.g., Minas Tirith, Edoras, etc.).
Border-holds [ B ]: Sites of relative safety (usually in Border regions), but
 still dangerous due to bandits, assassins, traitors, etc. (e.g., Bree, Lake-
 town, etc.).
Ruins & Lairs [ r ]: Deserted sites often inhabited by dangerous creatures
 (e.g., the Lonely Mountain, Barrow-downs, etc.).
Shadow-holds [ S ]: Relatively deserted sites often
 inhabited by dangerous creatures and Shadow-forces
 (e.g., Goblin-gate, Mount Gram, etc.).
Dark-holds [ D ]: Very dangerous sites with heavy concentrations of Shadow-
 forces (Dol Guldur, Barad-d–r, Minas Morgul, etc.).

There  are  two ways to move from one site to another. A company can  use  site
paths (see the Starter Rules) or it can use region cards.
 To  use region movement, play a new site card (face down) and a series of up to
four  regions (face down) that connect the current site with the new site (i.e.,
it  moves).  For  the purposes of movement, a series of regions  "connects"  two
sites if:
 The starting site is in one of the regions, and
 That region is adjacent to one of the other regions, and
 That region is adjacent to one of the other regions, . , and
 Finally, the last region contains the new destination site.
 If  two sites are separated by more than four regions, a company may not travel
directly  between  them in one turn. The company must first  travel  to  interim
sites (one per turn) until it reaches a site that is within four regions of  the
destination site.
 You  can  use  a  creature  hazard to directly attack one  of  your  opponent's
companies  if  at least one of the region types (two for creatures that  require
two symbols of the same type) on the creature's card matches that region type of
a region card played by that company.
