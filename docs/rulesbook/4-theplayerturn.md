Play  consists  of  a series of "Player Turns." During your  turn,  follow  the steps  outlined in this section. Then, your opponent does the same during his turn. You and your opponent alternate turns until the game ends.

During  your  turn,  you  take various actions during the following phases:
1. Untap Phase
2. Organization Phase
3. Long-event Phase
4. Movement/Hazard Phase
5. Site Phase
6. End-of-Turn Phase

#### Untap Phase

Each of your characters may do one of the following:
- Untap  or
- Heal (if at a Haven site).
Untap all of your other tapped non-site cards.

#### Organization Phase

- Play a character card or a Wizard card.
- Reorganize your characters at the same Haven into any number of companies (each company needs its own Haven site card).
- Shift your characters between being controlled by general influence and being controlled by direct influence.
- Transfer items between your characters at the same site. A corruption check is required for the character giving up an item.
- Store items or other designated resources from your companies at a Haven site or at sites specified on the item cards. A corruption check is required for the character giving up an item.
- Each of your companies may do one of the following:
  - Stay at its current site.
  - Play another site (face down) that can be moved to directly from the company's current site (i.e., its site of origin).
  - Standard Rules Only: Play a new site card and a series of up to four specific regions that connect the current site with the new site. (See Page 36.)

#### Long-event Phase

First, remove all of your resource long-events already in play.
Then, play any new resource long-event cards.
Finally, remove all of your opponent's hazard long-events.

#### Movement/Hazard Phase
 
Follow this procedure for each of your companies. You decide which of your companies goes first, second, etc.:
1. If the company has a face down site card, turn it over.
2. If the company did not move, no cards are drawn. If the company moved to a non-haven site, you may draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that it moved to (at least one card must be draw); your opponent does the same. If the company moved to a haven site, you may draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that you moved from (at least one card must be draw); your opponent does the same.
3. Your opponent plays and resolves hazards on the company. Hazard creatures must be "keyed to" the company's site path and/or new site. If a creature is keyed to more than one region type and/or site type that applies, your opponent decides which one is used. These hazards are resolved one at a time and in some cases may not directly affect the company. A hazard may not be played if it targets a different company or a character in a different company.<br>The maximum number of hazards that may be played on a company during a given movement/hazard phase (i.e., the hazard limit) is equal to the larger of two or the size of the company (Hobbits count half, round up). The hazard limit is determined for each company at the beginning of the movement/hazard phase (e.g., it remains fixed).
4. If the company has been required to return to its site of origin, remove the new site card and proceed to step 6. No additional hazards may be played on that company.
5. Remove the company's old site card (i.e., the site the company came from). Discard the site card if it is tapped and not a Haven. Otherwise, return it to the location deck. At this point, the company is considered to be at the new site. Standard Rules Only: Return any region cards to the location deck.
6. You must discard any cards in excess of eight in your hand; your opponent does the same for his hand. If you have fewer than eight cards, you must draw cards until your hand has eight cards; your opponent does the same for his hand.

#### Site Phase

In the order you decide, each of your companies at an untapped site may:
- do nothing or 
- follow this procedure:
  1. You decide to enter and explore the site.
  2. If the site has an automatic-attack, it attacks the company.
  3. The company may attempt to play one item, ally, faction, or information resource card that is "playable" at that site. Generally, this will involve tapping the character that will control the card played. If the resource card is successfully played, the site card is tapped and one additional character may tap to play a minor item.<br>Certain resource cards other than items, allies, factions, and information will state under what conditions they may be played. Such cards may be played at tapped and untapped sites, and do not tap a site when played.

Standard Rules Only: One of your characters or your Wizard may attempt to influence away of one of your opponent's characters, followers, allies, factions, or items. See Pages 37-38.

#### End-of-Turn Phase

You may discard one card. Then you must draw or discard cards until your hand has 8 cards. Your opponent does the same for his hand.
