Follow these steps to get ready to play:
 1. Place your site cards in your Location deck. This deck should contain all of your Haven cards (i.e., Rivendell, Edhellond, Grey Havens, and Lorien). You may include any number of Haven cards, but only one of each non-Haven site card.
 2. Place between 25 and 50 Resource cards and an equal number of Hazard cards in your play deck (if you have fewer than 25 of either available, just use all of the cards you have). Only one of each "unique" card may be included. No more than three copies of any one non-unique card may be included.
 3. Place one to five starting characters (no Wizards) face down in front of you. The combined mind attributes of these characters must be 20 or less. You and your opponent reveal your characters simultaneously, placing any duplicated characters into your play decks. Then organize your starting characters into followers and companies and place them at Rivendell.
 4. You may assign up to two non-unique minor items to your starting characters. These do not come from your play deck.
 5. Place up to 10 character cards in your play deck. Only one of each character card may be included. In addition, place up to two Wizard cards in your play deck (you may place two copies of the same Wizard). Shuffle your play deck.
 6. Draw a hand of eight cards from your play deck.
 7. Each player makes a roll, and the player with the highest result goes first (reroll if tied).

Add your region cards to your location deck.

Note: For play balance, we recommend both players have access to approximately the same number of region cards.
