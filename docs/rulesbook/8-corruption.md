Each  character has a corruption point total. This starts at zero, but  certain
cards  and  activities will increase and decrease this total during  play.  Most
cards  that affect a character's corruption are kept under the character's  card
until  they  are discarded. Only one corruption card may be played  on  a  given
character each turn.
Corruption Checks
 When  a  card  indicates  that one of your characters must  make  a  corruption
check, you must make a roll (2D6) and add any appropriate modifications:
  If  the  modified  result  is  greater than the character's  corruption  point
  total, nothing happens.
  If  the modified result is equal to the character's corruption point total  or
  one  less  than the character's corruption point total, you must  discard  the
  character along with any non-follower cards he controls. In this case, if  the
  character is a Wizard, you immediately lose the game.
  Otherwise,  the character is eliminated and you must discard any  non-follower
  cards  he  controls.  In  this  case,  if  the  character  is  a  Wizard,  you
  immediately lose the game.
                                       
 As  characters adventure in Middle-earth, they are subject to temptations. They
run  the  risk  of becoming corrupted and leaving the cause of the Free  Peoples
(i.e., a corrupted character leaves play, a corrupted Wizard loses the game). In
The Lord of the Rings, Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast was corrupted by
the  lure of nature, Alatar and Pallando succumbed to unrevealed corruptions and
disappeared into the East.
 A  character's corruption point total can be determined at any time by  summing
the  corruption  point values of the corruption cards under  his  card.  Certain
characters  receive modifications to corruptions checks, and certain  cards  may
give modifications to a corruption check. Modifications to corruption checks are
printed  in  the  lower right of the appropriate card. A plus or  a  minus  sign
indicates a modification rather than corruption points.

Before  the roll is made for a corruption check, you may tap characters in  the
same company as the character making the check. The corruption check is modified
by +1 for each such character
and/or Wizard tapped.
