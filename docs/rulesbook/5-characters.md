## CHARACTERS AND COMPANIES

As a player, you influence and control a number of characters that move and act in the world of Middle-earth. Each character’s abilities
are defined by these attributes: race, skills, direct influence, prowess (offense), body (defense), mind, marshalling points, and special abilities (e.g., corruption check modifiers). A character can be _eliminated_ and removed from play as a result of combat (failing a body check) or corruption (failing a corruption check[^fail]).

If you have enough general influence or direct influence during a given turn, you may bring into play: one character at his home site or at any Haven **or** your Wizard at his home site or Rivendell.

Characters are primarily controlled by your pool of 20 general influence points. For each controlled character, you must commit a number of general influence points equal to his mind attribute. In addition, you may control a character by using another character’s direct influence—a character controlled in this fashion is called a _follower_ and does not use general influence points. [See page 21 for
an extended example.]()

During play, you may organize your characters into groups called companies. A company’s _size_ is equal to the number of characters in it, with each Hobbit character only counting half (round up). A company is limited to a size of seven. A company’s _hazard limit_ is equal to two or the size of the company, whichever is greater. The maximum number of hazards that can be played on a company during a given movement/hazard phase is equal to its hazard limit. 

Companies can only combine at a Haven—just remove all but one of the companies’ Haven site cards. The resulting company then has one site card consisting of one Haven site card. One company can split into two or more companies only at a Haven (use two Haven cards).

One company can split into two or more companies only at a Haven[^splittingatanon-haven] (use two Haven cards).

> **Note:** The number of characters you have in play limits the number of actions you may take during a given turn. You use your Wizard’s general influence or your other characters’ direct influence on a character to bring that character into play and to keep it in play. A character in play can move and take actions (e.g., defending against attacks, influencing, etc.). Items, allies, and other cards representing things a character acquires and controls are placed under his card.

## CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES

Each character's abilities are defined by the fo llowing attributes (the notation for certain attributes is given in brackets).

_Race:_ This is one criterion for using certain resources and for bringing certain items, characters, and factions into play (e.g., only a Dwarf can fully utilize a Dwarven Ring). The races are: Elf, Hobbit, Dwarf, Dunadan, Man, Wizard, Orc, Troll, and Ringwraith.

_Skills:_ This is one of the criterion for using certain cards (e.g., warrior skill is required to use certain weapons). The skills are: warrior, scout, ranger, sage, and diplomat. Some characters have more than one skill.



## INFLUENCING (CONTROLLING) A CHARACTER

You have a pool of 20 general influence points. At the end of your
organization phase, the total mind attributes of your characters in
play (not counting followers) must be less than or equal to 20; this
total is equal to your used general influence points. Your unused
general influence points help your charru::ters resist the effects of
certain cards (e.g., Cail of Home, Muster Disperses, etc.).

### Direct Influence

Some characters have a direct influence attribute of one or more.
If such a character's direct influence is greater than or equal to
another one of your characters' mind attribute, he may take control
of that other character, who then becomes a follower of the control~
ling character. These conditions must be met:

## BRINGING CHARACTERS INTO PLAY

During your organization phase, you may perform one and only
one of the following activities:
• You may play a non-Ringwraith character card.
• You may play a Ringwraith card if you do not have one in play

## COMPANIES

A company is a group of characters that move and act together.
This allows characters to move, act, and defend as a unit, allowing
stronger characters to protecf the weaker characters. This mechanism
can be used to allow a variety of tactics during play.

### Limitations on Company Composition

Unless at a Darkhaven, a Ringwraith may not be in a company •
with other characters.

### Overt and Covery Companies

The text for certain cards distinguish between overt companies •
and covert companies. Any company that contains a Ringwraith in :
Fell Rider mode, an Ore, or a Troll is an overt company. Any other •
company is a covert company.

## HEALING

Each of your characters at a Darkhaven may heal during the untap
phase of your turn. Such a character moves from a wounded position
to a tapped position. In addition, certain cards can heal characters
when they are played (e.g., Foul Smeiling Paste).

## RINGWRAITH EFFECTS

After being revealed, a Ringwraith operates like any other char:
acter except that it may only be in a company with other characters
• if it is at a Darkhaven. There are several other special effects:
• Any gold ring in the Ringwraith'scompany is automatically tes ted
at the beginning of the end-of-turn phase. Any ring test in a
• Ringwraith' s company has a modification of -2.

As  a  player, you influence and control a number of characters that  move  and
act  in  the environment of Middle-earth. Each character's abilities are defined
by  the following attributes: race, skills, direct influence, prowess (offense),
body (defense), mind, marshaling points, and special abilities. A character  can
be eliminated and removed from play as a result of combat (failing a body check)
or corruption (failing a corruption check).
 If  you have enough general influence or direct influence during a given  turn,
you  may bring into play: one character at his home site or at any Haven or your
Wizard at his home site or Rivendell.
 Characters  are  primarily  controlled by your pool  of  20  general  influence
points.  For  each  controlled character, you must commit a  number  of  general
influence  points equal to his mind attribute. In addition, you  may  control  a
character  by using another character's direct influence-a character  controlled
in this fashion is called a follower and does not use general influence points.
 During  play, you may organize your characters into groups called companies.  A
company's  size  is equal to the number of characters in it,  with  each  Hobbit
character  only  counting half (round up). A company is limited  to  a  size  of
seven.  A  company's hazard limit is equal to two or the size  of  the  company,
whichever  is  greater. The maximum number of hazards that can be  played  on  a
company during a given movement/hazard phase is equal to its hazard limit.
 Companies  can  only  combine  at  a Haven-just  remove  all  but  one  of  the
companies'  Haven  site  cards. The resulting company then  has  one  site  card
consisting of one Haven site card.
 One  company  can  split into two or more companies only at a  Haven-one  Haven
site card must be available for each company.
                                       
 Characters  provide  the main limiter on action during a  game.  You  use  your
Wizard's  general  influence or your other characters' direct  influences  on  a
character  to bring that character into play and to keep it in play. A character
in play can move and take actions (e.g., defending against attacks, influencing,
etc.).  Items, allies, and other cards representing things a character  acquires
and controls are placed under his card.
BRINGING CHARACTERS INTO PLAY
 During   your  organization  phase,  you  may  perform  one  of  the  following
activities:
 You may play a character card. You must have enough general influence or
 direct influence available to control the character. You must place him at his
 home site or at any Haven site.
 You may play a Wizard card if you do not already have one in play. You must
 place a Wizard at his home site or at Rivendell. You need not control a Wizard
 with influence-he represents you, the player.
 When  you  play  a character, you may place him into a company already  at  his
arrival site or he may become a new company (with  one character); you must play
the site card for his arrival site with him. If the appropriate site card is not
available, you may not play a character.
 Playing a character does not tap a site.
 Each  character  and Wizard is unique. So if you already have  a  character  in
play,  your opponent may not play the same character. Similarly, if a  character
has been eliminated, he may not be brought into play again by either player.
 Note:  If  you do not have enough influence to control all of your characters
 in  play,  you  must discard any excess characters at the end  of  your  next
 organization phase.
REVEALING A WIZARD
 Once  you decide to reveal your Wizard, you may still use your pool of  general
influence  points;  but, in addition, your Wizard acts as a  character  (a  very
powerful  one). While revealing your Wizard is a big advantage, it also  carries
with  it  the  danger  of  losing the game by losing your  Wizard  to  death  or
corruption.
 After  being  revealed, a Wizard operates as a character and thus may  use  his
direct influence just like any other character.
HEALING
 Each  of  your  characters at a Haven may heal during the untap phase  of  your
turn. Such a character moves from a wounded position to a tapped position (i.e.,
the  character is still tapped). In addition, certain cards can heal  characters
when they are played (e.g., Healing Herbs, Halfling Strength, etc.).
CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES
 Each  character's  abilities  are  defined by  the  following  attributes  (the
notation for certain attributes is given in brackets):
Race: This is one criterion for bringing certain items, characters, and factions
 into  play (e.g., only a Dwarf can fully utilize a Dwarven Ring, only a DŁnadan
 can  use  Athelas, etc.). The races are: Elf, Hobbit, Dwarf, DŁnadan, Man,  and
 Wizard.
Skills:  This  is  one of the criterion for using certain cards  (e.g.,  warrior
 skill  is  required  to use certain weapons). The skills are:  warrior,  scout,
 ranger, sage, and diplomat. Some characters have more than one skill.
Direct  Influence [ i ]: A character's direct influence determines how  many  of
 your  characters  he  may  control (i.e., have as followers).  In  addition,  a
 character's   unused  direct  influence  affects  his  chances  of  influencing
 factions and your opponent's resources.
Prowess  [lower left, to left of "/"]: A character's prowess is a measure  of  a
 character's offensive capabilities in combat.
Body  [lower  left,  to right of "/"]: A character's body is a  measure  of  how
 difficult  it is to physically damage the character. This is a mixture  of  the
 ability  to  avoid  an  attack (e.g., dodging) and the  ability  to  absorb  or
 deflect an attack (e.g., armor, shield, blocking).
Mind  [ m ]: A character's mind determines how many influence points (a Wizard's
 general  influence  points  or  a  character's  direct  influence  points)  are
 required to keep this character in play (i.e., controlled).
Marshaling  Points [ upper left ]: This is the number of marshaling  points  you
 receive  when  you  have  the  character in play.  This  value  represents  the
 character's importance to the Free Peoples' struggle against Sauron.
Special  Abilities: Some characters have special abilities that are detailed  on
 their  cards and certain resource cards. For example, Faramir has an  influence
 bonus  against the Rangers of Ithilien faction,  owyn has a heightened  prowess
 against Nazg–l, Frodo has a corruption check modifier, etc.
INFLUENCING (CONTROLLING) A CHARACTER
 You  have  a  pool of 20 general influence points. At any one time,  the  total
mind attributes of your characters in play (not counting followers) must be less
than  or equal to 20; this total is equal to your used general influence points.
Your  unused  general  influence points help your  characters  resist  influence
attempts made by your opponent.
Direct Influence
 Some  characters have a direct influence attribute of one or more.  If  such  a
character's  direct influence is greater than or equal to another  one  of  your
characters'  mind  attribute, he may take control of that other  character,  who
then  becomes a follower of the controlling character. The following  conditions
must be met:
 The  total mind attributes of all of a character's followers may not exceed his
 direct influence.
 A  character can take control of another character that is in play only if both
 characters are at the same site.
 A  follower  does  not  require influence points from your  general  pool.  The
follower  must remain stacked under the character exerting the direct  influence
at  all times. A follower may not use his direct influence to control characters
(i.e., a follower may not have his own followers). A follower is handled in  all
other  ways as a normal character (e.g., counts for company size, takes  actions
normally, etc.).
 If  you  have enough unused general influence points, you may move  a  follower
from  direct  influence  to  general  influence  (or  vice  versa)  during  your
organization phase.
 If  a  character  directly influencing a follower is  removed  from  play,  the
follower remains in play. However, during your next organization phase, you must
discard  the follower, place the follower under the control of another character
in  his  company with enough available direct influence, or place  the  follower
under the control of general influence (if enough is available).
COMPANIES
 A  company  is  a group of characters that move and act together.  This  allows
characters to move and defend as a unit, allowing stronger characters to protect
the  weaker characters. This mechanism can be used to allow a variety of tactics
during play.
                                       
 For  example,  if  you  have 3 characters in play, the 3  characters  can  move
separately  and perhaps do more in terms of acquiring marshaling points  (items,
other  characters,  etc.); but each individual character is more  vulnerable  to
danger.  However,  the  same 3 characters operating as a company  might  acquire
marshaling points more slowly, but they are safer (i.e., you risk less).
 Normally,  a company is limited to a size of seven, but a company  at  a  Haven
site may be of any size. For these purposes, a Wizard counts as a character, but
an  ally does not. The size of a company is determined for each company  at  the
beginning  of  the  movement/hazard phase (e.g., it  remains  fixed  even  if  a
character leaves the company).
Example:  In  this example the notation "##" is used. The first  number  is  the
character's  mind attribute; the second is his direct influence (DI).  You  have
nine  characters  you want to control: Gandalf (-10), Aragorn II  (93),  Boromir
II  (41),  Legolas  (62),  Gimli (62), Frodo (51), Sam  (40),  Merry  (41),  and
Pippin (41). In addition, Aragorn II has Narsil (+1 to direct influence),  Frodo
has The One Ring (+5 to direct influence), and Gandalf has a Lesser Ring (+2  to
direct  influence).  In order for you to control and keep  these  characters  in
play,  you  must use all of your 20 points of general influence (GI)  and  their
direct influence (DI).
 First,  Gandalf does not require any influence-he's your Wizard. You  use  your
GI  to  control  Frodo, Aragorn II, and Gimli. This uses all 20  points:  5  for
Frodo, 9 for Aragorn II, and 6 for Gimli. Gandalf has 12 DI (his normal 10  plus
2  for  the Lesser Ring), so he uses it to control Sam, Merry, and Pippin  (they
become his followers). Aragorn II has 4 DI (his 3 plus 1 for Narsil), so he uses
it  to control Boromir II. Frodo has 6 DI (his 1 plus 5 for The One Ring), so he
uses  it  to  control Legolas. The company size is 7 because Hobbits only  count
half.
 The resulting character control organization is outlined below:
                  General Influence (-20)
Gandalf (-10)Gimli (62)Aragorn (93)Frodo (51)
Sam (40)Merry (41)    Pippin (41)Boromir (41) Legolas (62)

There are several Standard Rules changes involving characters and companies.
Splitting a Company at a Non-Haven Site
 During  the  organization phase, a company at a non-haven site may  split  into
two or more companies. The following instructions apply:
 One of the companies may remain at the current site.
 One  of  the  companies may return to the Haven site indicated by  the  current
 site's site path.
 Any other companies must move to other sites using region cards.
Joining Two Companies at a Non-Haven Site
 During  the  Organization Phase, two companies may move to the same  site,  but
one of the following cases must apply:
 One  and  only one company may already be at the site. In this case  the  other
 company must state that its new site card is already in play (the current  site
 card for the non-moving company).
 One  company moves to the site using the site path on that site card,  and  the
 other  company moves to the site using region cards for its site path. In  this
 case, both companies must state that the same face down site card is their  new
 site card.
 In  both  cases, the two companies must face hazards separately  and  are  then
combined at the end of the movement/hazard phase.
Discarding Characters
 Instead  of  bringing a new character/Wizard into play during your organization
phase,  you  may discard a character that is at a Haven or at his home  site.  A
Wizard  may not be discarded. You must take this action when you are  forced  to
discard a character due to a lack of available influence.
Bringing Characters into Play
 Before  you  play  your  Wizard,  you may use  general  influence  to  bring  a
character  into  play  at any haven or at his home site.  After  revealing  your
Wizard,  you  may use general influence to bring a character into play  only  if
your Wizard is at the site at which the character arrives (i.e., a Haven or  the
character's home site).

[^fail] A character is eliminated if they fail a [corruption check](/rulesbook/corruption) roll by two or more. A character is discarded is the corruption check fails by tieing or by 1.
