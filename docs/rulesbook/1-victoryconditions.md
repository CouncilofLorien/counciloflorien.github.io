## The Longer Games

The  Starter  Game  is  also called the "1-deck game." For experienced  players with  tuned  decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you  want  longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.

### The 2-deck game

In  a  "2-deck game" (the "short game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council when your play deck  has been  exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted once and you have at  least 25 marshaling points (MPs).

### The 3-deck game
 
In  a  "3-deck  game" (the "long game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck  has  been exhausted three times. You may call the Council when  your  play deck has been exhausted three times, or when it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.

### The 4-deck game
 
In  a  "4-deck  game" (i.e., the "campaign game"), the Council is  called  when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You may call the Council when your play  deck  has  been exhausted four times, or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.

## THE COUNCIL, AUDIENCE, AND DAY

#### <span style="color:#1254c2">THE FREE COUNCIL</span>

{: .metw }
> Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check. The player who took the last turn makes corruption checks for his characters first.
> 
> At the Free Council, the leaders of the Free Peoples decide which Wizard’s advice is best to follow. This is based upon a comparison of the resources each of the Wizards has marshalled. 

#### <span style="color:#5d2396">THE AUDIENCE WITH SAURON</span>

{: .mele }
> Just before the Audience With Sauron, each non-Ringwraith character must make a corruption check. The player who took the last turn makes corruption checks for his characters first.
> 
> At the audience, Sauron decides which Ringwraith has been the most successful and will deliver the first massive blow against the Free Peoples. This is based upon a comparison of the resources each of the Ringwraiths has marshalled.

#### <span style="color:#7e685d">THE DAY OF RECKONING</span>

{: .mewh }
> Just before your Day of Reckoning, each character must make a corruption check. The player who took the last turn makes corruption checks for his characters first.
> 
> At your Day of Reckoning, your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards completing your own personal agenda.
> 
> You do not receive marshalling points for cards stored at non-Wizardhaven sites.

#### <span style="color:#d74431">THE DAY OF DECISION</span>

{: .meba }
> Just before the Audience With Sauron, each non-Ringwraith character must make a corruption check. The player who took the last turn makes corruption checks for his characters first.
> 
> At your Day of Decision, your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards taking your true place in Middle-earth

> **Clarification:** Characters do not automatically untap when the Free Council, Audience with Sauron, Day of Reckoning, or Day of Decision are called. A character may only untap during his own untap phase.
> **Clarification:** A character that is discarded or eliminated by his corruption check prior to the Free Council, Audience with Sauron, Day of Reckoning, or Day of Decision is no longer in play. That character and any non-follower cards he controls are not available at the Free Council, Audience with Sauron, Day of Reckoning, or Day of Decision—thus, they do not count towards the marshalling point totals.
> 
> A player may play resource cards that can affect his characters’ corruption checks made prior to the the Free Council, Audience with Sauron, Day of Reckoning, or Day of Decision. Hazard cards may _not_ be played.
> 
> After all characters have made their corruption checks, the game ends if one Wizard has failed his corruption check (the other player wins). If both Wizards fail their corruption checks, no one wins—both players lose (if you have to, roll dice and the high roller is the winner).

The winner of the game is the player that has gathered the most marshalling points from:
- Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
- Defeating certain creatures.
- Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
- By avoiding negative points which accrue when certain characters that you control are eliminated (e.g., Aragorn II, Galadriel, Elrond, Círdan, Frodo, and Bilbo).

Marshalling points are printed on the top left corner of the cards that award them.

> **Note:** You may find it useful to use pencil and paper or extra dice to keep a running total of marshalling points.
> **Clarification:** If both players have the same number of marshalling points, the game ends in a tie—both players win (if you have to, roll dice and the high roller is the winner).

## Marshaling Point Modifications

There are six different types of marshaling points; each is associated with a specific shape:

- Character Points
- Item Points (Major, Greater, & Rings only)
- Faction Points
- Ally Points
- Kill Points (from defeating certain creatures)
- Miscellaneous Points

These types of marshaling points can affect your marshaling point total in two ways (apply them in the order listed):

- If your opponent has zero (or negative) points for any one type of marshaling points, your points for that same type of marshaling points are doubled. This doesn't apply to kill points and miscellaneous points.
- No  more  than half (round up) of your marshaling points can come from any one type of marshaling points. If one type of marshalling points is over half of your total, reduce the points for that type until they are only half (or less) of your total).

Finally, you may reveal any unique marshalling point cards in your hand that match unique cards your opponent has in play. Each such revealed card reduces your opponent's final MP total by one.

> **Clarification:** These marshalling point modifications do not apply until the Council, Audience, or Day actually takes place. Specifically, the modifications do not affect your MP total when it is used to determine if you can call the Council, Audience, or Day (i.e., you need 20 MPs to call before any modification).

> **Example:** (CPs = Corruption Points, MPs = Marshalling Points) Our two players Jessica and Jason have been playing for awhile and Jessica exhausts her play deck during her turn. Since she has 15 MPs and Jason only has 14, she decides to call the Free Council. Each player has one company in Lórien:
