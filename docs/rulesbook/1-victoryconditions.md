     - The Starter Game (**1-deck** game):
       - When each play deck has been exhausted **once**. They start at the end of the current turn.
       - After you have exhausted your play deck for the **first** time, you may choose to call at the end of any of your turns. Your opponent gets one last turn.

     - The Short Game (**2-deck** game)
       - When each play deck has been exhausted **twice**. They start at the end of the current turn.
       - After you have exhausted your play deck for the **second** time, you may choose to call at the end of any of your turns. Your opponent gets one last turn.

## The Longer Games

The  Starter  Game  is  also called the "1-deck game." For experienced  players with  tuned  decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you  want  longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.

### The 2-deck game

In  a  "2-deck game" (the "short game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council when your play deck  has been  exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted once and you have at  least 25 marshaling points (MPs).

### The 3-deck game
 
In  a  "3-deck  game" (the "long game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck  has  been exhausted three times. You may call the Council when  your  play deck has been exhausted three times, or when it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.

### The 4-deck game
 
In  a  "4-deck  game" (i.e., the "campaign game"), the Council is  called  when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You may call the Council when your play  deck  has  been exhausted four times, or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.

> <h1>1 • THE VICTORY CONDITIONS</h1>
> 
> The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
> 1. If your Wizard is "eliminated" (i.e., through combat or corruption)—your opponent wins.
> 2. If you move _The One Ring_ to Mount Doom and play certain cards—_The One Ring_ is destroyed and you win.
> 3. Otherwise, the winner is decided at the _Free Council_.<br>This council is called when one of the following occurs:
>     - When each play deck has been exhausted once, the council starts at the end of the current turn.
>     - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose to call the council at the end of any of your turns. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
>     - You may choose to call the council at the end of your turn if you have accumulated at least 20 marshalling points. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
> > **Note:** If one or both players only has access to a starter deck (76 cards), this requirement of 20 marshaling points should be lowered to 18.
> 
> <h2>The Free Council</h2>
> 
> Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check. The winner of the game is the player that has gathered the most marshalling points from:
> - Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
> - Destruction of creatures and/or evil forces.
> - Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
> - By avoiding negative points which accrue when certain characters that you control are eliminated.

> You may find it useful to use pencil and paper **or** extra dice to keep a running total of marshalling points.
> 
> <h3>Marshalling Point Modifications</h3>
> 
> At the Free Council, you may reveal any unique marshalling point cards in your hand that match unique cards that your opponent has in play. Each such revealed card reduces your opponent's marshaling point total by one.
> 
> There  are six different types of marshalling points; each is associated with a specific shape:
> - Character Points — hexagon
> - Item Points (Major, Greater, & Rings only) — rectangle 
> - Faction Points — inverted triangle
> - Ally Points — triangle 
> - Kill Points (from defeating creatures) — circle 
> - Miscellaneous Points — diamond
> 
> These types of marshalling points can affect your marshalling point total in two ways:
> - No more than half (round up) of your marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling points.
> - If your opponent has zero (or negative) points for any one type of marshalling points, your points for that same type of marshalling points are doubled. This doesn't apply to kill points and miscellaneous points.

> > 
> > **Example:** (CPs = Corruption Points, MPs = Marshalling Points) Our two players Jessica and Jason have been playing for awhile and Jessica exhausts her play deck during her turn. Since she has 15 MPs and Jason only has 14, she decides to call the Free Council. Each player has one company in Lorien:
> > 
> > **Jessica Controls:** 
> > - Men of Lebennin (faction) — 2 MP
> > - Dreams of Lore (information) — 2 MP
> > - Pallando 
> >     - Sword of Gondolin (item) — 2 CP, 2MP 
> >     - Gwaihir (ally) — 2 MP 
> > - Celeborn — 2 MP
> > - Gildor Inglorion — 1 MP 
> >     - Healing Herbs (item) — 1 CP 
> > - Legolas — 2 MP
> >     - Elfstone (item) — 1 CP
> >     - Dagger of Westernesse (item) — 1 CP
> > - Elrohir — 1 MP
> > - Elladan — 1 MP
> > 
> > **Jason Controls:**
> > - Radagast
> > - Beorn — 2 MP
> >     - Quickbeam (ally) — 2 MP
> > - Theoden — 2 MP
> >     - Sword of Gondolin — 2 CP, 2 MP
> >     - Great Shield of Rohan — 2 CP, 2 MP
> > - Faramir — 2 MP
> >     - Dagger of Westernesse — 1 CP
> >     - Healing Herbs — 1 CP
> > - Imrahil — 2 MP
> > 
> > Since Jessica called the council, Jason gets one final turn before the council starts. Jason brings Eomer into play for one more MP, and then moves his company to Lake-town. After facing the hazards Jessica plays, he successfully plays the Men of Northern Rhovanion faction for two more MPs. Jason now have 17 MPs and will win the game if he does not lose any MPs due to characters failing corruption checks.
> > 
> > In this example, any character with 2 or more CPs could fail his corruption check (see pages 35-36). If Pallando fails his corruption check, the game ends immediately and Jason wins. If Legolas fails his corruption check, Jessica loses 2 of her MPs. If Theoden fails his corruption check, Jason loses 6 of his MPs. If Faramir fails his corruption check, Jason loses 2 of his MPs.

> 
> > **Clarification:** These marshalling point modifications do not apply until the Free Council actually takes place. Specifically, the modifications do not affect your marshalling point total when it is used to determine if you can call the Free Council (i.e., you need 20 MPs to call the Free Council before any of these modifications are made).
> > 
> > **Example:** Let's look again at our example from page 11. Assume Jason failed to play the Men of Northern Rhovanion (3 MPs[^menofnorthernrhovanion]) on his last turn. Assume none of the characters failed a corruption check (i.e., they all come to the Free Council).
> > 
> > Jessican notices that Jason has no faction points (he blew his roll to get the Men of Northern Rhovanion). So her faction points are doubled to 4.
> > 
> > Unfortunately, Jason's problems are not over. He failed to get the 3 MPs[^menofnorthernrhovanion] from the Men of Northern Rhovanion; so his MP total is only 14—8 of them are character points and only 6 are non-character points. Since you cannot have more than hald of your points from any one source, Jason only gets 6 MPs from his characters.
> > 
> > At this point, the marshalling points (MPs) break down as follows:
> > 
> > **Jessica's MP Cards**
> > - Celeborn — 2 MPs
> > - Elladan — 1 MPs
> > - Elrohir — 1 MPs
> > - Gildor Inglorion — 1 MPs
> > - Legolas — 2 MPs
> > - Sword of Gondolin (item) — 2 MPs
> > - Men of Lebennin (faction) — 4 MPs (2 MPs doubled)
> > - Gwaihir (ally) — 2 MPs
> > - Dreams of Lore (misc) — 2 MPs
> > 
> > **Total — 17 MPs**
> > 
> > **Jason's MP Cards**
> > - Beorn — 2 MPs
> > - Faramir — 2 MPs
> > - Imrahil — 2 MPs
> > - Theoden — 0 MPs (reduced by 2 MPs)
> > - Sword of Gondolin (item) — 2 MPs
> > - Great Shield of Rohan (item) — 2 MPs
> > - Quickbeam (ally) — 2 MPs
> > 
> > **Total —  12 MPs**
> > 
> > At this point, Jason reveals that he has cards for Gwaihir, Legolas, and Elrohir in his hand (he was saving them for this). Since they duplicate three of Jessica's unique MP cards, her MP total is reduced by one for each of these cards. Thus, Jessica ends up with 14 MPs and Jason ends up with 12 MPs—Jessica wins. Jason curses his luck because he failed to bring the Men of Northern Rhovanion into play on his last turn.

> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
> 
> There are two different _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ (_MEBA_) boxes—The Shadow-deeps (reddish) and the Balrog's Host (bluish). Together, these two boxes contain at least one copy of each of the 104 _MEBA_ expansion cards. So, if you have purchased both boxes, you have a complete set of the _MEBA_ cards. 

[^menofnorthernrhovanion]: The _Men of Northern Rhovanion_ faction is worth 2 marshalling points, not 3. The _Men of Dorwinion_ faction is worth 3 marshalling points.
