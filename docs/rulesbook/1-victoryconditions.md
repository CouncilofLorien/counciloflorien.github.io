The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
 1. Defeat by elimination or corruption
 2. Victory by _The One Ring_
 3. Otherwise, the winner is decided at the Free Council, Audience with Sauron, Day of Reckoning, or Day of Decision. These are called when one of the following occurs:
     - The Starter Game (**1-deck** game):
       - When each play deck has been exhausted **once**. They start at the end of the current turn.
       - After you have exhausted your play deck for the **first** time, you may choose to call at the end of any of your turns. Your opponent gets one last turn.
       - You may choose to call at the end of your turn if you have accumulated at least **20** marshalling points. Your opponent gets one last turn.
     - The Short Game (**2-deck** game)
       - When each play deck has been exhausted **twice**. They start at the end of the current turn.
       - After you have exhausted your play deck for the **second** time, you may choose to call at the end of any of your turns. Your opponent gets one last turn.
       - After you have exhausted your play deck for the **first** time, you may choose to call at the end of your turn if you have accumulated at least **25** marshalling points. Your opponent gets one last turn.
       
## The Longer Games

The  Starter  Game  is  also called the "1-deck game." For experienced  players with  tuned  decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you  want  longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.

### The 2-deck game

In  a  "2-deck game" (the "short game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council when your play deck  has been  exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted once and you have at  least 25 marshaling points (MPs).

### The 3-deck game
 
In  a  "3-deck  game" (the "long game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck  has  been exhausted three times. You may call the Council when  your  play deck has been exhausted three times, or when it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.

### The 4-deck game
 
In  a  "4-deck  game" (i.e., the "campaign game"), the Council is  called  when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You may call the Council when your play  deck  has  been exhausted four times, or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.

> > - Imrahil — 2 MP
> > 
> > Since Jessica called the council, Jason gets one final turn before the council starts. Jason brings Eomer into play for one more MP, and then moves his company to Lake-town. After facing the hazards Jessica plays, he successfully plays the Men of Northern Rhovanion faction for two more MPs. Jason now have 17 MPs and will win the game if he does not lose any MPs due to characters failing corruption checks.

> > In this example, any character with 2 or more CPs could fail his corruption check (see pages 35-36). If Pallando fails his corruption check, the game ends immediately and Jason wins. If Legolas fails his corruption check, Jessica loses 2 of her MPs. If Theoden fails his corruption check, Jason loses 6 of his MPs. If Faramir fails his corruption check, Jason loses 2 of his MPs.

> - If your opponent has 20 marshalling points _and_ you play a _Sudden Call_ card as a **hazard** during one of his turns, the audience starts following your next turn (i.e., you get one last turn). 

## The White Hand

{: .mewh }
> > <h1>THE VICTORY CONDITIONS</h1>
> > 
> As a Fallen-wizard you may win in the same way a _METW_ Wizard wins: your opponent is eliminated **or** you recover _The One Ring_ **or** you have the most marshalling points at the Free Council. The following exceptions apply:
> - In order to win by recovering _The One Ring_ at least one _A New Ringlord_ card must be played and the conditions outlined on that card must be met.
> - The Free Council is handled normally, and victory is determined in the standard way by comparing marshalling points. However, to you (a Fallen-wizard) it is called your **Day of Reckoning** and your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards completing your own personal agenda.
> - You do not receive marshalling points for cards stored at non-Wizardhaven sites.

## The Challenge Decks

{: .mech }
> <h1>2 • VICTORY CONDITIONS</h1>
> 
> The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
> 1. If your Wizard or Ringwraith is "eliminated." In this case your opponent automatically wins. As an exception in tournament play, the game continues. However, the player whose Wizard or Ringwraith is eliminated loses give MPs off his final total, and cannot reveal a new Wizard or Ringwraith.
> 2. A Wizard player calls the Free Council. The Free Council may be called either:
>     - After you have exhausted your play deck for the second time, you may choose to call the council. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn. This gives your opponent one last turn to catch up to you.
>     - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first tiem, you may choose to call the council if you have accumulated at least 25 marshalling points. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn.
>     - When each play deck has been exhausted twice, the council starts at the end of the current turn.
> 3. A Ringwraith player calls the Audience with Sauron. The audience may be called either:
>     - When each play deck has been exhausted twice, the audience starts at the end of the current turn.
>     - After you have exhausted your play deck twice you may choose to play _Sudden Call_ as a resource. If you do so, the audience starts at the end of your opponent's next turn.
>     - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose to play _Sudden Call_ as a resource, if you have at least 25 marshalling points. If you do so, the audience starts at the end of your opponent's next turn.
>     - After your opponent has exhausted his deck twice, you may play _Sudden Call_ as a hazard. If you do so, the audience is called after your next turn.
>     - After your opponent has exhausted his play deck once, if he has at least 25 marshalling points, you may play _Sudden Call_ as a hazard. If you do so, the audience is called after your next turn.
>
> If your opponent has no marshalling points in a category (besides kill and miscellaneous), you may double your points in that category. No more than hald of your positive MPs may come from one category.
> 
> This is called the two-deck form of play. Other games are possible (_METW_ Rules, p. 49; _MELE_ Rules, p. 51).

## The Balrog

{: .meba }
> <h1>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h1>
> 
> As a Balrog player, you may win in the same way a _MELE_ Ringwraith wins: your opponent is eliminated **or** you recover _The One Ring_ **or** you have the most marshalling points at the Audience with Sauron. The following exceptions apply:
> - In order to win by recovering _The One Ring_ at least one _Challenge the Power_ card must be played and the conditions outlined on that card must be met.
> - The Audience with Sauron is handled normally, and victory is determined in the standard way by comparing marshalling points. However, to you (The Balrog) it is called your **Day of Decision** and your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards taking your true place in Middle-earth. You must play _Sudden Call_ to call your Day of decision.

[^menofnorthernrhovanion]: The _Men of Northern Rhovanion_ faction is worth 2 marshalling points, not 3. The _Men of Dorwinion_ faction is worth 3 marshalling points.
[^sixmptypes]: There are 6 MP types, not 5. This error was not present in _METW_ or _TW Unlimited_.
[^grishnahk]: Typo of Grishnahk.
[^halforless]: You do not "round up" as in the _METW Limited_ rules nor is there any need to reduce MP to "half of less" as in the _METW Unlimited_ and _MELE_ rules. As explained in the CRF [End-of-Game](/crf/turnsequence#end-of-game): "_When determining if more than half of your marshalling points come from one type of marshalling point, ignore negative marshalling points. The easy way to do this is if one category is more than half of your positive marshalling points, reduce that category to equal all of your other positive marshalling point categories combined._"
