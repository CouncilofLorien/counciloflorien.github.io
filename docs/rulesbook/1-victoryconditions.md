## The Longer Games

The  Starter  Game  is  also called the "1-deck game." For experienced  players with  tuned  decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you  want  longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.

### The 2-deck game

In  a  "2-deck game" (the "short game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council when your play deck  has been  exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted once and you have at  least 25 marshaling points (MPs).

### The 3-deck game
 
In  a  "3-deck  game" (the "long game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck  has  been exhausted three times. You may call the Council when  your  play deck has been exhausted three times, or when it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.

### The 4-deck game
 
In  a  "4-deck  game" (i.e., the "campaign game"), the Council is  called  when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You may call the Council when your play  deck  has  been exhausted four times, or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.

> <h1>1 • THE VICTORY CONDITIONS</h1>
> 
> The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
> 1. If your Wizard is "eliminated" (i.e., through combat or corruption)—your opponent wins.
> 2. If you move _The One Ring_ to Mount Doom and play certain cards—_The One Ring_ is destroyed and you win.
> 3. Otherwise, the winner is decided at the _Free Council_.<br>This council is called when one of the following occurs:
> - When each play deck has been exhausted once, the council starts at the end of the current turn.
> - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose to call the council at the end of any of your turns. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
> - You may choose to call the council at the end of your turn if you have accumulated at least 20 marshalling points. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
> > **Note:** If one or both players only has access to a starter deck (76 cards), this requirement of 20 marshaling points should be lowered to 18.
> 
> <h2>The Free Council</h2>
> 
> Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check. The winner of the game is the player that has gathered the most marshalling points from:
> - Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
> - Destruction of creatures and/or evil forces.
> - Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
> - By avoiding negative points which accrue when certain characters that you control are eliminated.
> 
> Marshalling  points are printed on the top left corner of the cards that award them.
>

> You may find it useful to use pencil and paper **or** extra dice to keep a running total of marshalling points.
> 
> <h3>Marshalling Point Modifications</h3>
> 
> At  the Free Council, you may reveal any unique marshaling point cards in your hand that match unique cards that your opponent has in play. Each such revealed card reduces your opponent's marshaling point total by one.
> 
> There  are six different types of marshalling points; each is associated with a specific shape:
> - Character Points
> - Item Points (Major, Greater, & Rings only)
> - Faction Points
> - Ally Points
> - Kill Points (from defeating creatures)
> - Miscellaneous Points

> | Kill Points (from defeating creatures) | circle |
> | Miscellaneous Points| diamond | 
> 
> These types of marshaling points can affect your marshalling point total in two ways:
> - No more than half (round up) of your marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling points.
> If your opponent has zero (or negative) points for any one type of marshalling points, your points for that same type of marshalling points are doubled. This doesn't apply to kill points and miscellaneous points.

That character and any non-follower cards he controls are not available at the Free Council—thus, they do not count towards the marshalling point totals.<br>A player may play resource cards that can affect his characters’ corruption checks made prior to the Free Council. Hazard cards may _not_ be played.<br>After all characters have made their corruption checks, the game ends if
one Wizard has failed his corruption check (the other player wins). If both Wizards fail their corruption checks, no one wins—both players lose (if you have to, roll dice and the high roller is the winner).

## The Challenge Decks

{: .mecd }
> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
> 
> Welcome to the _MECCG Challenge Decks_. This box contains everything you need, except for a pair of dice, to challenge any opponent to a fun and competitive match of the _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_).
> 
> The deck is preconstructed with cards available from teh following sets of _MECCG_: _Middle-earth: The Wizards_, _Middle-earth: The Dragons_, _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_, _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_, _Middle-earth: Against the Shadow_, and _Middle-earth: The White Hand_. Also, some promitional cards printed though _The White Hand_ were used. The cards were all originally printed as common or uncommon except for 3 rares per deck. The cards were chosen to complement each other in order to achieve maximum success in play, yet be rewarding as the story of the deck unfolds. _Challenge Deck_ cards reflect published errata and clarifications.
> 
> The deck is tournament-read for the two-deck game. This is the game format presented in the Rules Summary. It observes the following Council of Lorien tournament rules: (a) 12-creature minimum; (b) 30-card resource/hazard minimum; (c) up to three Wizards/Ringwraiths allowed in the play deck; (d) Ringwraith players having +5 general influence that cannot control characters; and (e) Ringwraiths and their starting companies beginning play at Minas Morgul or Dol Guldur. If your Wizards or Ringwraith is eliminated, you do not lose the game, but rather lose five marshalling points off your final total and continue playing.
> 
> The Council of Lorien is the sanctioning body of official _MECCG_ tournament play in the United States and Canada. For more information on the COuncil and coordinating a sanctioned _MECCG_ tournament, contact ICE promotion at 1 (800) 325-0479.
> 
> The deck has 30 resources and 30 hazards, a complete complement of characters and sites for carrying out the resource strategy, and a 20 card sideboard. As per the tournament rules update in _The White Hand_, the sideboard is allowed to contain up to 30 cards. You should consider adding 10 cards to the sideboard when using this deck in a two-deck tournament, as this is certainly legal and adds to your deck's ability to react to an opponent.
> 
> After becoming familiar with your challenge deck, you may want to modify it. You can bring in more powerful cards, or you may want to vary its predictability for playing against familiar opponents. You may want to make the deck even more competitive in a two-deck tournament. For example, the following hazards can benefit almost any _Challenge Deck_: _Mouth of Sauron_, _Uvatha the Horseman_, _Adunaphel_, _Daelomin at Home_, _My Precious_, _Lure of Power_, and _Durin's Bane_. Ringwraith players should consider if Dragon factions would fit into their existing resource mix. There are 9 Dragon factions all told, each worth from 3 to 6 faction marshalling points. Some excellent resources almost any Wizard deck can integrate are: the ally _Tom Bombadil_, the faction _Woses of Old Pukel-land_, and the item _The Mithril-coat_. 
> 
> <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
> 
> In _MECCG_ you play as one of the Wizards or Ringwraiths, trying to influence the Free Peoples or Sauron into letting you lead their armies.
> 
> You control one or more companies, which are groups of characters. These companies move around Middle-earth from site to site. At the sites they can gain resources, which provide you with marshalling points (MPs). The marshalling points for a card are in the upper left-hand corner of the card. The accumulation of marshalling points is the primary way of winning the game.
> 
> During the game you may "reveal" yourself. To do this you play a Ringwraith or Wizard card. That card represents you in the game. If that card is eliminated, through combat or corruption, then you lose the game.
> 
> While your opponent is moving, you get to play hazards on his companies. These hazards represent the creatures and events your opponent must deal with while traveling in Middle-earth.

## The Balrog

{: .meba }
> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
> 
> There are two different _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ (_MEBA_) boxes—The Shadow-deeps (reddish) and the Balrog's Host (bluish). Together, these two boxes contain at least one copy of each of the 104 _MEBA_ expansion cards. So, if you have purchased both boxes, you have a complete set of the _MEBA_ cards.
