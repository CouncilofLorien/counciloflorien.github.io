 You  may  only play hazard cards during your opponent's movement/hazard  phase.
Except for resource long-events, you may play resource cards anytime during your
own turn unless specifically prohibited by the rules or the cards themselves.
 Unless  stated otherwise, a card is playable only if its effect applies  to  an
existing situation, hazard, attack, etc. (i.e., you may not play a card just  to
discard it).
 During  your  movment/hazard phase, both players draw cards when  each  company
moves. If a company moves to a non-haven site, you may draw up to the number  of
cards  indicated by the site that it moved to (at least one card must be drawn);
your  opponent does the same. If the company moves to a haven site, you may draw
up  to  the number of cards indicated by the site that you moved from (at  least
one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same.
THE HAZARD LIMIT
 During  your opponent's movement/hazard phase, the number of hazard cards  that
you may play on one of your opponent's companies is that company's hazard limit.
The hazard limit is equal to two or the company's size, whichever is greater.  A
company's  size  is equal to the number of characters in it,  with  each  Hobbit
counting  half (round up). For this purpose, Wizards and followers do  count  as
characters, but allies do not.
 A  hazard limit can be modified by the play of certain cards. Tapping a  Nazg–l
permanent-event does count against the hazard limit.
STORING CARDS
 During your organization phase, you may store any of your items that are  at  a
Haven  site.  The controlling character must make a corruption check  before  an
item can be stored.
 A  stored  item  is placed in your marshaling point pile and still  counts  for
marshaling  points.  Once an item is stored it may not be unstored  and  brought
back into play. The One Ring may not be stored.
 Some  items and resource cards state that they can be stored when at a specific
site (e.g., the Book of Mazarbul can be stored at a Dwarf-hold). Such an item or
resource card is still placed in the marshaling point pile and cannot be brought
back into play.
TRANSFERRING ITEMS
 During  your  organization phase, you may transfer items between characters  at
the same site. The controlling character must make a corruption check before  an
item can be transferred.
ACTIONS AND CARD PLAY
 The  various activities that you and your opponent can perform during play  are
called  actions.  Typical  actions  include playing  a  card,  tapping  a  card,
revealing  a  card,  etc. The following general guidelines  apply  to  resolving
actions; more detailed guidelines can be found on pages 39-41.
 You  must  give  your opponent a chance to respond to every  action,  and  vice
 versa.  If  you perform an action and move on to another action without  giving
 your  opponent a chance to respond, you must "backup" if he indicates  that  he
 wants  to respond. A series of declared actions made in respond to one  another
 is  called  a  chain of effects. You always have the option  of  declaring  the
 first action in a chain of effects during your turn. The actions in a chain  of
 effects are resolved one at a time from last declared to first declared  (i.e.,
 the  last  declared  action is resolved first, then the  second  to  the  last,
 etc.).
 If  the  play  of a card requires other actions (e.g., corruption checks),  the
 actions are resolved in the order in which they appear on the card.
 A  required or declared dice roll is a action and can be the target of  another
 action or effect declared later in the same chain of effects.
 When  the  effects of a dice roll require further actions (e.g., a roll  for  a
 strike  requires  a  body check), those actions become the first  actions  (any
 further rolls come first) in the next chain of effects after the roll.
HAZARD CARDS
 Hazard  cards  represent evil forces and natural dangers. You may  play  hazard
cards only during your opponent's movement/hazard phase.
Creature Cards
 You  may  use  a  creature  card  to directly attack  one  of  your  opponent's
companies. Such an attack can occur only if:
  The  company  is at a specific site at which the creature's card says  it  can
  be played.
  One  of  the  site symbols on the creature's card matches the  site  that  the
  company  moved to (i.e., the new site) or stayed at (i.e., if the company  did
  not move).
  At  least one of the region symbols on the creature's card matches one of  the
  region  types  the  company  moved through  this  turn  (see  below).  If  the
  creature's  card  has  two  region symbols of the  same  type  (i.e.,  a  deep
  wilderness  creature), then the company must have moved through at  least  two
  regions of that same type.
 If  a  creature  satisfies more than one of these conditions, you  must  choose
(when  you play the creature) one of these conditions that the attack is  "keyed
to."  The effects of certain cards are based upon the region or site type that a
creature is keyed to.
 The  region  types  that  a  company moves through  during  a  given  turn  are
determined by the following criteria:
 If a company did not play a new site card, it did not move through any
 regions-so, no creature may be played based solely on region conditions.
 If the company has played a new non-Haven site card but no region cards, the
 region types are indicated by the new site card's site path.
 If the company has played a new Haven site card but no region cards, the
 region types are indicated by the old site card's site path (i.e., the site
 path on the site that the company left).
 Standard Game Only: If the company played region cards, the region types are
 indicated by the region cards (i.e., each region card has a region type).
RESOURCE CARDS
 You  may  only  play  certain  resource cards if specific  required  conditions
exist.
Allies - A character may tap to play an ally card if he is at the site specified
on  the ally card and the character meets the requirements indicated on the ally
card.  The  ally  card is placed under the character's card and  that  character
controls  the ally. After an ally is played at a site, the site card is  tapped.
An ally does not count as a character for any purposes other than combat.
Items  -  If  a character is at an untapped site that indicates that a  specific
type  of item card (gold ring, minor, major, or greater) is "playable,"  he  may
tap  to bring an item of that type into play. The item card is placed under  the
character's card. After an item is played at a site, the site card is tapped.
 A  character may only use the effects of one weapon at a time and one shield at
a time and one armor at a time.
 If  a  character is eliminated by corruption, discard all of the items that  he
controls. If a character is eliminated due to failing a body check, one item can
be  transferred to each unwounded character in his company; but, the rest of his
items are discarded.
Factions - One of your characters may tap to play a faction card if he is at the
site specified on the faction card and the character successfully influences the
faction  as indicated on the faction's card (see page 28). The faction  card  is
placed in your play area. After a faction is successfully played at a site,  the
site card is tapped.
EVENTS
 There are both resource events and hazard events. Each event falls into one  of
three classifications based upon how long it stays in play.
Short-event  -  A  short-event's effects are immediately implemented.  Then  the
event  card  is discarded. The effects of some short-events last for a  specific
period as stated on its card (e.g., many short-event effects last "until the end
of the turn").
Long-event - The effects of a long-event are immediately implemented when it  is
played.  Long-events last approximately two turns, one of yours and one of  your
opponent's.
 You  may only play a resource long-event during your long-event phase. Its card
and  effects remain in play until your next long-event phase or until  otherwise
discarded.
 You  may  only  play a hazard long-event during your opponent's movement/hazard
phase. Its card and effects remain in play until your opponent's next long-event
phase or until otherwise discarded.
Permanent-event  -  The  effects of a resource permanent-event  are  immediately
implemented. Its effects last until the card is discarded. Certain  effects  can
cause a permanent-event to be discarded.

 There are several Standard Rules changes involving playing cards.
Limits on Drawing cards
 During  your  turn,  you may draw cards based on one of your  moving  companies
only  if  the  company contains at least one character with a mind attribute  of
three or more.
Placing a Card On-guard
 During  the  movement/hazard phase of your opponent's turn, you may  place  one
card  on-guard for each of your opponent's companies. This card is  played  face
down  next to the company's new site or next to its current site if it  did  not
move.  Any  card can be placed on-guard (i.e., it does not have to be a  hazard,
you  can bluff). Such a card does count against the hazard limit for the company
it is placed on.
 The card will remain on that site until one of the following occurs:
 The  company decides to face the site's automatic-attack. If the on-guard  card
 is  a  hazard creature keyed to the company's site or a hazard that can  modify
 the  automatic-attack,  it  may  be revealed  before  the  automatic-attack  is
 resolved.  If  it  is  a hazard creature, it will attack after  the  automatic-
 attack is resolved.
 The  company  plays a card keyed to the site. If the on-guard card  is  a  non-
 creature  hazard,  it may be revealed if it is a hazard that  directly  affects
 the  company  or  a character in the company (e.g., a hazard  that  forces  all
 characters to make a corruption check).
 Otherwise, return the card to your hand at the end of the site phase.
 In  the  first  two cases, the card is handled as if it had been played  during
the  movement-hazard phase (i.e., short-events are discarded,  long-events  last
until your opponent's next long-event phase, etc.).
Dice Roll Timing
 Before  a  roll  is made for combat or a check, cards may be played  that  will
modify  the  result  of the roll. However, once the roll is  actually  made,  no
further  cards  may  be played that modify the dice roll result.  This  modified
result  is  used  to determine effects of the combat or check before  any  other
actions are taken. When the effects of a dice roll require other actions  (e.g.,
a  successful  strike requires a body check) those actions  become  the  initial
actions  (any further rolls come first) in the next chain of effects  after  the
roll.
Timing Rules
 You  and  your  opponent may both want to perform actions at the same  time  or
actions that are sequenced with respect to other actions. This can happen during
your  movement/hazard phase (or during your site phase if your  opponent  has  a
card  on-guard).  Such actions almost always include playing a card,  tapping  a
card already in play, and revealing an on-guard card.
 Your  opponent may always declare an action in response before your  action  is
resolved. Then, you may respond to his action, and he can respond to your second
action, and so on until neither player can (or wants to) perform an action.
 You  must  give  your opponent a chance to respond to every  action,  and  vice
versa.  If  you  perform an action and move on to another action without  giving
your  opponent  a chance to respond, you must "backup" if he indicates  that  he
wants to respond.
 Such  a  series  of declared actions is called a chain of effects.  You  always
have  the option of declaring the first action in a chain of effects during your
turn.  The  actions in a chain of effects are resolved one at a time  from  last
declared  to  first declared (i.e., the last declared action is resolved  first,
then the second to the last, etc.).
 You  may  follow  one of your declared actions with another  of  your  declared
actions in the same chain of effects, so long as you give your opponent a chance
to respond to first action.
 An  action  in  a  chain  of effects is negated if the conditions  required  to
perform it are negated by another action that is resolved before it in the chain
of effects.
Timing Example: You play Weariness of the Heart on Bilbo to force him to make  a
corruption check. Your opponent taps Frodo (2nd action in this chain of effects)
to  give  Bilbo  +1 to this check. You play Call of Home on Bilbo (3rd  action),
which  forces  Bilbo to make a successful roll or return to  his  owner's  hand.
Finally, your opponent plays Tookish Blood on Bilbo. This cancels any effect for
the  rest of the turn which would discard Bilbo or send him to his owner's hand.
Now you resolve actions from last to first:
 Tookish Blood takes effect.
 Call of Home takes effect, but Tookish Blood negates any effect it would have.
 Frodo  gives  +1  to  Bilbo's corruption check (an action can  target  a  dice-
 rolling  action  that was declared earlier in the same chain of  effects,  even
 though the dice-rolling action has not taken effect).
 Bilbo  makes  his  corruption check-he rolls the dice adding  +1  to  his  roll
 because  of  Frodo's  help  (other modifications not discussed  here).  Tookish
 Blood cancels any result of this corruption check that would discard Bilbo.
 If  your  opponent had played Tookish Blood on Bilbo after his dice roll,  i.e.
after  this chain of effects was resolved, it would not have affected your  Call
of  Home  nor Bilbo's corruption check. Tookish Blood only cancels those actions
that occur during the rest of the turn, and not prior actions.
 Consider  if Tookish Blood had not been played and if you played Call  of  Home
on  Frodo.  First Frodo rolls for Call of Home when resolving the chain.  If  he
fails this check, Frodo goes back to your opponent's hand. The 2nd action in the
chain  would  then  be negated because the conditions required  to  perform  it,
namely Frodo being in Bilbo's company, were negated by your Call of Home.
