# INTRODUCTION

 During  the Third Age, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth to  unite  and counsel  the  Free  Peoples in their struggles against Sauron,  the  Dark  Lord.
However, they were forbidden to dominate the peoples of Middle-earth or to match the  power  of  Sauron with power. These five were known as the "Wizards"  (also
called  Istari)  in  Middle-earth, and individually they were  called:  Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar, and Pallando.

 In  Middle-earth: The Wizards, you play one of these five Wizards. Your goal is to  marshal the forces of the Free Peoples so that Sauron can be resisted  until the One Ring is destroyed. Since your fellow Wizards do not agree on how to best accomplish  this goal, you must battle for the minds, bodies, and souls  of  the Free Peoples.

 In  The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf was the only Wizard to succeed. Saruman  was corrupted  by power, Radagast "went native," and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East. Only Gandalf remained true to his task, eventually marshaling the characters  and  forces  that  withstood Sauron's  might  long  enough  for  the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring.

 "Evil  Forces"  are  represented by hazards that the players  use  against  one another.  For  example, if you move a character into Moria, your opponent  could play  a  Troll  card  as  a hazard. These hazards are not  "controlled"  by  the Wizards,  but rather they represent the forces of Sauron, who himself  is  in  a "dormant" or hiding phase. The players are "good," so conflict takes the form of hazards  and  direct attempts to "persuade" or "dominate" each  other  and  each other's characters and forces.

# USING THIS RULESBOOK
 The  rules  for playing the Middle-earth: The Wizards (METW) game are organized
into four parts:
The  Starter Rules - These rules contain all of the guidelines you need to  play
 METW.  These  rules have been designed to simplify teaching  the  game  and  to
 speed  up play. You should use the Starter Rules if you and your opponent  have
 never  played  this game before or if one of you only has access to  a  starter
 deck (76 cards).
  If  you  are already an experienced player of collectible card games, you  can
 initially read the next couple of pages and the sections marked with a  bar  on
 one  side.  Then, as you play, you can refer to the other sections that  detail
 the more complex rules and special situations that can arise during play.
The  Standard  Rules - These rules assume you have already played several  games
 using  the  Starter  Rules.  The  Standard  Rules  consist  of  additions   and
 extensions  to  the  Starter  Rules  that make  play  and  deck  building  more
 flexible,  exciting,  and  interesting.  We  recommend  that  experienced  METW
 players use all of the Standard Rules.
The  Optional Rules - These rules provide interesting variations to the standard
 rules. Before play begins, both players must agree on which optional rules  are
 to be used.
The  Appendices  - This part contains reference material that can  prove  useful
 during  play:  an index, a map of Middle-earth, a full turn summary,  a  symbol
 key, etc.
 The  Starter  and Standard Rules are for a two-player game; multi-player  rules
are provided in the Optional Rules.

# PLAYER TURN SUMMARY
 Play  consists  of  a series of "Player Turns." During your  turn,  follow  the
steps  outlined in this turn summary. Then, your opponent does the  same  during
his turn. You and your opponent alternate turns until the game ends.
Untap  Phase  - Each of your characters may do one of the following:  Untap   or
 Heal  (if  at  a Haven site). In addition, untap all of your other tapped  non-
 site cards.
Organization  Phase  -  You take the following actions in any  order:  play  one
 character  (or your Wizard), reorganize your companies, transfer items  between
 characters  (corruption  checks required), and store items  (corruption  checks
 required).  In  addition,  each of your companies  may  plan  its  movement  by
 playing a new site card face down on its present site card.
Long-event Phase - Remove all of your resource long-events already in play. Play
 any  new resource long-event cards. Remove all of your opponent's hazard  long-
 events.
Movement/Hazard  Phase  -  One  at a time, each  of  your  companies  takes  the
 following  actions. The company turns over its new site card (if it  has  one).
 Then,  each  player  draws cards as indicated on a new site  card.  Next,  your
 opponent  may play hazard cards on the company; the maximum number  of  hazards
 that  may be played on a company is equal to the the size of the company (to  a
 minimum of two). Finally, remove the old site card and each player discards  or
 draws so that he has eight cards in his hand.
Site  Phase  -  One  at  a time, each of your companies may take  the  following
 actions  at  its  current,  untapped site. The company  decides  to  enter  and
 explore  the site. If the site has an automatic-attack, it attacks the company.
 The  company  may  attempt  to  play one item, ally,  faction,  or  information
 resource card that is "playable" at that site. A character in the company  must
 tap to make this attempt. If the card is successfully played, tap the site.
End-of-Turn Phase - Each player may discard one card. Then each player must draw
 or discard so that his hand has eight cards.
 
# PLAYER NOTES
 Site  cards (and region cards in the Standard Game) represent the geography  of
 Middle-earth. They are used to control the acquisition of resources,  but  they
 should  not direct play. Instead, a player should examine the resources in  his
 hand  and  then select a nearby site to travel to. Initially, do not worry  too
 much  about  which  site to use, just pick one that has the resource  type  you
 want  to  play.  It also helps if you select the location cards  you  are  most
 likely to use when you put together a play deck.
 In  METW  you  will draw multiple cards each turn, and in some cases  you  will
 have  to  discard a number of cards each turn. Don't let this worry  you,  it's
 part  of  the flow of play. Just keep cards that are immediately useful  during
 the  next turn or that are crucial to your overall strategy (i.e., your primary
 resource acquisition strategy).
Notes For Players of other Collectible Card Games
 If  you  have played other collectible card games (CCG), there are several  key
factors to keep in mind:
 METW  is  less  tactical  and more strategic than some  other  CCGs.  There  is
 combat, but it is not the dominant focus of the game.
 The  players  in  METW  are in direct competition with each  other  to  marshal
 resources.  However, only hazards directly attack the players'  characters  and
 they  are  handled  in a less controlled fashion (e.g., they  are  only  played
 during  your opponent's movement/hazard phase, hazard creatures do  not  remain
 in play, etc.).
 For  timing  purposes, all cards in METW are played and tapped  with  the  same
 "speed"  (effects take place instantly). But, a player may only  play  resource
 cards  during his own turn, and a player may only play hazard cards during  his
 opponent's movement/hazard phase.
