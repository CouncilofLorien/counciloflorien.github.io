# The Victory Conditions

1  THE VICTORY CONDITIONS

  The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
 1) If your Wizard is "eliminated" (i.e., through combat or
  corruption)-your opponent wins.
 2) If you move The One Ring to Mount Doom and play certain cards-The One Ring
  is destroyed and you win.
3) Otherwise, the winner is decided at the FreeCouncil.
 This council is called when one of the following occurs:
   When each play deck has been exhausted once, the council starts at the end
    of the current turn.
   After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose
    to call the council at the end of any of your turns. The council starts at
    the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last
    turn).
   You may choose to call the council at the end of your turn if you have
    accumulated at least 20 marshaling points. The council starts at the end of
    your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
    Note:  If  one  or  both players only has access to  a  starter  deck  (76
    cards), this requirement of 20 marshaling points should be lowered to 18.
The Free Council
 Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check.  The
winner  of  the game is the player that has gathered the most marshaling  points
from:
   Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
   Destruction of creatures and/or evil forces.
   Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
   By avoiding negative points which accrue when certain characters that you
    control are eliminated.
 Marshaling  points are printed on the top left corner of the cards  that  award
them.
                                       
 At  the  Free  Council, the leaders of the Free Peoples decide  which  Wizard's
advice is best to follow. This is based upon a comparison of the resources  each
of the Wizards have marshalled.
 You  may find it useful to use pencil and paper or extra dice to keep a running
total of marshaling Points.
