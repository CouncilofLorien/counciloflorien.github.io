## 1 • THE VICTORY CONDITIONS

{: .metw }
> The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
> 1. If your Wizard is "eliminated" (i.e., through combat or corruption)—your opponent wins.
> 2. If you move _The One Ring_ to Mount Doom and play certain cards—_The One Ring_ is destroyed and you win.
> 3. Otherwise, the winner is decided at the _Free Council_. 
> 
> This council is called when one of the following occurs:
> - When each play deck has been exhausted once, the council starts at the end of the current turn.
> - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose to call the council at the end of any of your turns. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
> - You may choose to call the council at the end of your turn if you have accumulated at least 20 marshaling points. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).

### The Free Council
>
> Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check. The winner of the game is the player that has gathered the most marshalling points from:
> - Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
> - Destruction of creatures and/or evil forces.
> - Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
> - By avoiding negative points which accrue when certain characters that you control are eliminated (e.g., Aragorn II, Galadriel, Elrond, Círdan, Frodo, and Bilbo).
> 
> Marshalling points are printed on the top left corner of the cards that award them.

> > A character that fails his corruption check prior to the Free Council is no longer in play. That character and any non-follower cards he controls are not available at the Free Council—thus, they do not count towards the marshalling point totals.

> 1. If your Ringwraith is "eliminated" (i.e., fails a body check)—your opponent wins.
> 2. If you move _The One Ring_ to Barad-dur—Sauron is reunited with _The One Ring_ and you win. (See Rings for more on Rings.)

{: .note }
If  one  or  both players only has access to  a  starter  deck  (76 cards), this requirement of 20 marshaling points should be lowered to 18.

#### The Free Council
Just before the Free Council, each character must make a corruption check.  The winner  of  the game is the player that has gathered the most marshaling  points from:
- Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
- Destruction of creatures and/or evil forces.
- Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
- By avoiding negative points which accrue when certain characters that you control are eliminated.
Marshaling  points are printed on the top left corner of the cards  that  award them.
At  the  Free  Council, the leaders of the Free Peoples decide  which  Wizard's advice is best to follow. This is based upon a comparison of the resources  each of the Wizards have marshalled.
You  may find it useful to use pencil and paper or extra dice to keep a running total of marshaling Points.

#### Marshaling Point Modifications
 At  the Free Council, you may reveal any unique marshaling point cards in  your hand  that match unique cards that your opponent has in play. Each such revealed card reduces your opponent's marshaling point total by one.
 There  are six different types of marshaling points; each is associated with a specific shape:
  Character Points
  Item Points (Major, Greater, & Rings only)
  Faction Points
  Ally Points
  Kill Points (from defeating creatures)
  Miscellaneous Points
 These types of marshaling points can affect your marshaling point total in two ways:
- No  more  than half (round up) of your marshaling points can come from any one type of marshaling points.
- If  your  opponent has zero (or negative) points for any one type of marshaling points,  your points for that same type of marshaling points are doubled. This doesn't apply to kill points and miscellaneous points.

#### The Longer Games

 The  Starter  Game  is  also called the "1-deck game." For experienced  players with  tuned  decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you  want  longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.
 
 In  a  "2-deck game" (the "short game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council when your play deck  has been  exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted once and you have at  least 25 marshaling points (MPs).
 
 In  a  "3-deck  game" (the "long game"), the Council is called when  each  play deck  has  been exhausted three times. You may call the Council when  your  play deck has been exhausted three times, or when it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.
 
 In  a  "4-deck  game" (i.e., the "campaign game"), the Council is  called  when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You may call the Council when your play  deck  has  been exhausted four times, or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshaling points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.
 
{: .mewh }
> As a Fallen-wizard you may win in the same way a METW Wizard wins: your opponent is eliminated or you recover The One Ring or you have the most marshalling points at the Free Council. The following exceptions apply:
> - In order to win by recovering The One Ring at least one A New Ringlord card must be played and the conditions outlined on that card must be met.
> - The Free Council is handled nonnally, and victory is determined in the standard way by comparing marshalling points. However, to you (a Fallen-wizard) it is called your Day of Reckoning and your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards completing your own personal agenda.
> - You do not receive marshalling points for cards stored at nonWizardhaven sites.

{: .meba }
> As a Balrog player you may win in the same way a MELE Ringwraith wins: your opponent is eliminated or you recover The One Ring or you have the most marshalling points at the Audience with Sauron. The following exceptions apply:
> - In order to win by recovering The One Ring, at least one Challenge the Power card must be played and the conditions outlined on that card must be met.
> - The Audience with Sauron is handled normally, and victory is determined in the standard way by comparing marshalling points. However, to you (a Fallen-wizard) it is called your Day of DEcision and your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards taking your true place in Middle-earth. You must play Sudden Call to call your Day of Decision.
