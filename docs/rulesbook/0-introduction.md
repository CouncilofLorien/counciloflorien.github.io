## Middle-earth CCG

The _Middle-earth collectible card game_ was published by Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), Charlottesville, Virginia USA between 1995 and 1998. It was printed as a two base sets (_The Wizards_ and _The Lidless Eye_) and five expansions (_The Dragons_, _Dark Minions_, _Against the Shadow_, _The White Hand_, and _The Balrog_). The _Middle-earth CCG_, _The Hobbit_, _The Lord of the Rings_, and all characters and places therein are trademark properties of Tolkien Enterprises.

## Introduction

During the Third Age, Sauron the Dark Lord returned and threatened to enslave all of Middle-earth. Against Sauron's threat, the Valar sent five Maiar, known as "Wizards," to Middle-earth to unite and counsel the Free. These five were known as “Wizards” (also called Istari) in Middle-earth, and individually they were called: Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar, and Pallando. 

_In Middle-earth: The Wizards_, you play one of these five Wizards. Your goal is to marshal the forces of the Free Peoples so that Sauron can be resisted until the One Ring is destroyed. 

In _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye (MELE)_, you play one of Sauron's nine Ringwraiths, the Nazgul. Your goal is to marshal enough resources so that the Dark Lord will be confident enough to send you and your armies to launch the first blow necessary to crush the Free Peoples. 

In _Middle-earth: The White Hand_ you play as a "Fallen-wizard," like Saruman who was corrupted by power, Radagast who “went native,” or Alatar and Pallando who both disappeared into the East. As a Fallen-wizard, you have your own goals and can pick and choose the good and evil resources you will use to achieve your ends.

In _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ you play as The Balrog. His goals are basic and simple—accumulate power and destroy his enemies.

While direct conflict can occur between companies of good and evil, most conflict takes the form of _hazards_ or attempts to persuade or dominate each other's characters and forces. These hazards are not "controlled" by the Wizards or Ringwraiths, but rather they represent the evil or dangerous forces that are abroad in Middle-earth, which the players user against one another.

## Player Turn Summary

 Play consists of a series of "Player Turns." During your turn, follow the steps outlined in this turn summary. Then, your opponent does the same during his turn. You and your opponent alternate turns until the game ends. This turn summary is included here to give you an idea of how play proceeds; see [4 • THE PLAYER TURN](/rulesbook/playerturn).
 - _**Untap Phase**_ — Each of your characters may do one of the following: Untap or Heal (if at a Haven site). In addition, untap all of your other tapped non-site cards.
 - _**Organization Phase**_ — You take the following actions in any order: play one character (or your Wizard), reorganize your companies, transfer items between characters (corruption checks required), and store items (corruption checks required). In addition, each of your companies may plan its movement by playing a new site card face down on its present site card.
 - _**Long-event Phase**_ — Remove all of your resource long-events already in play. Play  any new resource long-event cards. Remove all of your opponent's hazard long-events.
 - _**Movement/Hazard Phase**_ — One at a time, each of your companies takes the following actions. The company turns over its new site card (if it has one). Then, each player draws cards as indicated on a new site card. Next, your opponent may play hazard cards on the company; the maximum number of hazards that may be played on a company is equal to the the size of the company (to a minimum of two). Finally, remove the old site card and each player discards or draws so that he has eight cards in his hand.
 - _**Site Phase**_ — One at a time, each of your companies may take the following actions at its current, untapped site. The company decides to enter and explore the site. If the site has an automatic-attack, it attacks the company. The company may attempt to play one item, ally, faction, or information resource card that is "playable" at that site. A character in the company must tap to make this attempt. If the card is successfully played, tap the site.
 - _**End-of-Turn Phase**_ — Each player may discard one card. Then each player must draw or discard so that his hand has eight cards.  
 
## Player Notes

- Site cards (and region cards in the Standard Game) represent the geography of Middle-earth. They are used to control the acquisition of resources, but they should not direct play. Instead, a player should examine the resources in his hand and then select a nearby site to travel to. Initially, do not worry too much about which site to use, just pick one that has the resource type you want to play. It also helps if you select the location cards you are most likely to use when you put together a play deck.
- In _Middle-earth_ you will draw multiple cards each turn, and in some cases you will have to discard a number of cards each turn. Don't let this worry you, it's part of the flow of play. Just keep cards that are immediately useful during the next turn **or** that are crucial to your overall strategy (i.e., your primary resource acquisition strategy).

### Notes For Players of other Collectible Card Games

 If you have played other collectible card games (CCG), there are several key factors to keep in mind:
 
- _Middle-earth_ is less tactical and more strategic than some other CCGs. There is combat, but it is not the dominant focus of the game. The players in _Middle-earth_ are in direct competition with each other to marshal resources. However, only hazards directly attack the players' characters and they are handled in a less controlled fashion (e.g., they are only played during your opponent's movement/hazard phase, hazard creatures do not remain in play, etc.).
- For timing purposes, all cards in _Middle-earth_ are played and tapped with the same "speed" (effects take place instantly). But, a player may only play resource cards during his own turn, and a player may only play hazard cards during his opponent's movement/hazard phase.
  > **Clarification:** The card, Twilight, is an exception to this rule—it can be played at anytime, either as a resource or as a hazard (it does not count against the hazard limit). Certain other cards specifically state when they may be played.

Since your fellow Wizards do not agree on how to best accomplish this goal, you must battle for the minds, bodies, and souls of the Free Peoples.
> 
> In _The Lord of the Rings_, Gandalf was the only Wizard to succeed. Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast “went native,” and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East. Only Gandalf remained true to his task, eventually marshalling the characters and forces that withstood Sauron's might long enough for the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring.
> 
> "Evil forces" are represented by _hazards_ that the players use against one another. For example, if you move a character into Moria, your opponent could play a Troll card as a hazard. These hazards are not "controlled" by the Wizards, but rather they represent the forces of Sauron, who himself is in a "dormant" or hiding phase. The players are "good," so conflict takes the form of hazards and direct attempts to "persuade" or "dominate" each other and each other's characters and forces.

Then, as you play, you can refer to the other sections that detail the more complex rules and special situations that can arise during play.
> - _The Standard Rules_ — These rules assume you have already played several games using the Starter Rules. The Standard Rules consist of additions and extensions to the Starter Rules that make play and deck building more flexible, exciting, and interesting. We recommend that experienced _METW_ players use all of the Standard Rules.
> - _The Optional Rules_ — These rules provide interesting variations to the standard rules. Before play begins, both players must agree on which optional rules are to be used.
> - _The Appendices_ — This part contains reference material that can prove useful during play: an index, a map of Middle-earth, a full turn summary, a symbol key, etc.

## The Lidless Eye

{: .mele }
> During the Third Age, Sauron the Dark Lord returned and threatened to enslave all of Middle-earth. However, having been defeated and almost destroyed in the Second Age, Sauron hesitated—he wanted to restore himself to full power before starting his final assault on the Free Peoples. This meant he needed to marshal overwhelming tactical and strategic resources: and, if possible, he needed to recover the lost reservoir of his vast might, The One Ring.
> 
> Sauron wanted to remain in the safety of Barad-Dur, in the center of his web of control. So his chief tools for gathering resources were his Ringwraiths the nine Nazgul. While Sauron could automatically exert control over any Nazgul, the Nazgul maintained a large amount of independence and free will—they were of little use to Sauron without it.
> 
> In _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye (MELE)_, you play one of these nine Ringwraiths, the Nazgul. Your goal is to marshal enough resources so that the Dark Lord will be confident enough to send you and your armies to launch the first blow necessary to crush the Free Peoples. Since your fellow Ringwraiths do not agree on how best to accomplish this goal (and of course none are as worthy as you), you must compete with them to be the first to gather enough forces to gain the Dark Lord's confidence. If your opponent has access to _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) cards, you will also be able to play a Ringwraith against a Wizard.
> 
> In _The Lord of the Rings_, the Witch-king of Angmar was the first Ringwraith to succeed. Sauron dispatched him and his armies to destroy Gondor. However, due to a subtle twist of fate, he fell on the brink of victory, not against a "man" of great power, but against a woman (Eowyn) and a single Hobbit (Merry).
> 
> "Dangerous forces" in _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_ are represented by _hazards_ that the players use against one another. For example, if you move a character into the Lonely Mountain, your opponent could play a Dragon card as a hazard. These hazards are not "controlled" by the Ringwraiths, but rather they represent the dangerous forces that are abroad in Middle-earth, threatening everyone, good and evil characters alike. All Ringwraiths are working to bring Sauron to full power, so conflict takes the form of hazards and direct attempts to "persuade" or "dominate" each other and each other's characters and forces, rather than the form of direct conflict.

## The White Hand

{: .mewh }
> During the Third Age, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth to unite and counsel the Free Peoples in their struggles against Sauron, the Dark Lord. However, they were forbidden to dominate the peoples of Middle-earth or to match the power of Sauron with power. These five were known as “Wizards” (also called Istari) in Middle-earth, and individually they were called: Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar, and Pallando.
> 
> In _The Lord of the Rings_, Gandalf was the only Wizard to succeed. Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast “went native,” and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East. Only Gandalf remained true to his task, marshalling the characters and forces that withstood Sauron long enough for the Fellowship to destroy the Ruling Ring.
> 
> _Middle-earth: The White Hand_ allows you to play one of these "Fallen-wizards." As a Fallen-wizard, you can pick and choose the good and evil resources you will try to utilize—you will use any means to achieve your ends. However, you can only exert your influence and control over the weaker heroes and minions—the more powerful characters can sense your greed and weaknesses.
> 
> Each Fallen-wizards is driven by a different obsession reflected in his abilities and goals:
> 
> - The fallen **Pallando** (Master of Doom) is the master of peoples and fate. He rules and dominates peoples. He is obsessed with building his own empire and defeating Sauron by force of arms.<br>
> - The fallen **Alatar** (Lord of the Hunt) is the master of animate nature—he is a hunter. He likes to do things personally. He is more likely to dominate individuals rather than peoples. He is obsessed with defeating Sauron by turning Middle-earth into a well-ordered game-preserve.<br>

## The Balrog

{: .meba }
> The Balrog is supremely confident of his own immense personal power. After all, just like Sauron, he was one of Morgoth's chief lieutenants. The Balrog tends to rely on brute force and direct confrontation rather than more subtle approaches often used by Ringwraiths and Wizards. His goals are basic and simple—accumulate power and destroy his enemies. If he can do this, he can become a dominant power in Middle-earth—a factor to which both the Dark Lord and the Free Peoples will be forced to react.
