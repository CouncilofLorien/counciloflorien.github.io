## The Middle-earth CCG

The _Middle-earth collectible card game_ was published by Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), Charlottesville, Virginia USA between 1995 and 1998. It was printed as a two base sets (_The Wizards_ and _The Lidless Eye_) and five expansions (_The Dragons_, _Dark Minions_, _Against the Shadow_, _The White Hand_, and _The Balrog_). The _Middle-earth CCG_, _The Hobbit_, _The Lord of the Rings_, and all characters and places therein are trademark properties of Tolkien Enterprises.

## Introduction

During the Third Age, Sauron the Dark Lord returned and threatened to enslave all of Middle-earth. Against Sauron's threat, the Valar sent five Maiar, known as "Wizards," to Middle-earth to unite and counsel the Free. These five were known as “Wizards” (also called Istari) in Middle-earth, and individually they were called: Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar, and Pallando. 

In _Middle-earth: The Wizards_, you play one of these five Wizards. Your goal is to marshal the forces of the Free Peoples so that Sauron can be resisted until the One Ring is destroyed. 

In _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye (MELE)_, you play one of Sauron's nine Ringwraiths, the Nazgul. Your goal is to marshal enough resources so that the Dark Lord will be confident enough to send you and your armies to launch the first blow necessary to crush the Free Peoples. 

In _Middle-earth: The White Hand_ you play as a "Fallen-wizard," like Saruman who was corrupted by power, Radagast who “went native,” or Alatar and Pallando who both disappeared into the East. As a Fallen-wizard, you have your own goals and can pick and choose the good and evil resources you will use to achieve your ends.

In _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ you play as The Balrog. His goals are basic and simple—accumulate power and destroy his enemies.

## Alignment

You may choose between three _alignments_ which determine the types of cards that may be included in your deck and the rules you follow: 
- _Heroes of the Free People_—The Hero alignment includes Wizard players using hero characters and resources.
- _Minions of Morgoth_—The Minion alignment includes Ringwraith, Sauron, and Balrog players using minion characters and resources.
- _Lackeys of a Fallen-wizard_—The Fallen-wizard alignment includes Fallen-wizard players using both hero and minion characters and resources.

While direct conflict can occur between the different alignments of companies, most conflict takes the form of _hazards_ or attempts to persuade or dominate each other's characters and forces. Hazards are not "controlled" by the Wizards or Ringwraiths, but rather they represent the evil or dangerous forces that are abroad in Middle-earth, which the players use against one another.
 
## Differences From Other Card Games

- Site cards and region cards represent the geography of Middle-earth. They are used to control the acquisition of resources, but they should not direct play. Instead, a player should examine the resources in his hand and then select a nearby site to travel to. Initially, do not worry too much about which site to use, just pick one that has the resource type you want to play. It also helps if you select the location cards you are most likely to use when you put together a play deck.
- In _Middle-earth_ you will draw multiple cards each turn, and in some cases you will have to discard a number of cards each turn. Don't let this worry you, it's part of the flow of play. Just keep cards that are immediately useful during the next turn **or** that are crucial to your overall strategy (i.e., your primary resource acquisition strategy). 
- _Middle-earth_ is less tactical and more strategic than some other CCGs. There is combat, but it is not the dominant focus of the game. The players in _Middle-earth_ are in direct competition with each other to marshal resources. However, only hazards directly attack the players' characters and they are handled in a less controlled fashion (e.g., they are only played during your opponent's movement/hazard phase, hazard creatures do not remain in play, etc.).
- For timing purposes, all cards in _Middle-earth_ are played and tapped with the same "speed" (effects take place instantly). But, a player may only play resource cards during his own turn, and a player may only play hazard cards during his opponent's movement/hazard phase. The card, _Twilight_, is an exception to this rule—it can be played at anytime, either as a resource or as a hazard.
- _Middle-earth_ uses the "hand-filling" card draw mechanic. Each player has a hand-size of 8 cards and both draw cards when each company moves. During a company's movement they can both play cards for or against that company. After, both players draw cards to fill their hand back to their hand-size of 8 cards. Any cards in excess of hand-size must be discarded. The players can also discard a card at the end-of-turn phase and then refill their hand. The more cards you play (or discard), the more cards you draw.
- There is no numerical currency to use when paying to play resource cards in Middle-earth. Instead, costs are typically paid by tapping characters or by tapping or discarding resources. In addition, because the game uses hand-filling card draw, another typical cost is for the game play to match a particular situation given on an event card. A card cannot be played if it does not apply to a given situation and it cannot be discarded for no effect. Hazard cards typically require a particular situation but the play of hazard cards is also restricted by the hazard limit (typically equal to the company's size).

> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
> 
> During the Third Age, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth to unite and counsel the Free Peoples in their struggles against Sauron, the Dark Lord. However, they were forbidden to dominate the peoples of Middle-earth or to match the power of Sauron with power. These five were known as “Wizards” (also called Istari) in Middle-earth, and individually they were called: Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar, and Pallando.
> 
>  _In Middle-earth: The Wizards_, you play one of these five Wizards. Your goal is to marshal the forces of the Free Peoples so that Sauron can be resisted until the One Ring is destroyed. Since your fellow Wizards do not agree on how to best accomplish this goal, you must battle for the minds, bodies, and souls of the Free Peoples.
> 
> In _The Lord of the Rings_, Gandalf was the only Wizard to succeed. Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast “went native,” and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East. Only Gandalf remained true to his task, eventually marshalling the characters and forces that withstood Sauron's might long enough for the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring.
> 
> "Evil forces" are represented by _hazards_ that the players use against one another. For example, if you move a character into Moria, your opponent could play a Troll card as a hazard. These hazards are not "controlled" by the Wizards, but rather they represent the forces of Sauron, who himself is in a "dormant" or hiding phase. The players are "good," so conflict takes the form of hazards and direct attempts to "persuade" or "dominate" each other and each other's characters and forces.
> 
> <h2>USING THIS RULESBOOK</h2>
> 
> The rules for playing the _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) game are organized into four parts:
> 
> - _The Starter Rules_ — These rules contain all of the guidelines you need to play _METW_. These rules have been designed to simplify teaching the game and to speed up play. You should use the Starter Rules if you and your opponent have never played this game before **or** if one of you only has access to a starter deck (76 cards).<br>If you are already an experienced player of collectible card games, you can initially read the next couple of pages and the sections marked with a bar on one side. Then, as you play, you can refer to the other sections that detail the more complex rules and special situations that can arise during play.
> - _The Standard Rules_ — These rules assume you have already played several games using the Starter Rules. The Standard Rules consist of additions and extensions to the Starter Rules that make play and deck building more flexible, exciting, and interesting. We recommend that experienced _METW_ players use all of the Standard Rules.
> - _The Optional Rules_ — These rules provide interesting variations to the standard rules. Before play begins, both players must agree on which optional rules are to be used.
> - _The Appendices_ — This part contains reference material that can prove useful during play: an index, a map of Middle-earth, a full turn summary, a symbol key, etc.
> 
> The Starter and Standard Rules are for a two-player game; multi-player rules are provided in the Optional Rules.
> 
> <h2>PLAYER TURN SUMMARY</h2>
> 
> Play consists of a series of "Player Turns." During your turn, follow the steps outlined in this turn summary. Then, your opponent does the same during his turn. You and your opponent alternate turns until the game ends.
> 
> - _Untap Phase_ — Each of your characters may do one of the following: Untap **or** Heal (if at a Haven site). In addition, untap all of your other tapped non-site cards.
> - _Organization Phase_ — You take the following actions in any order: play one character (or your Wizard), reorganize your companies, transfer items between characters (corruption checks required), and store items (corruption checks required). In addition, each of your companies may plan its movement by playing a new site card face down on its present site card.
> - _Long-event Phase_ — Remove all of your resource long-events already in play. Play any new resource long-event cards. Remove all of your opponent's hazard long-events.
> - _Movement/Hazard Phase_ — One at a time, each of your companies takes the following actions. The company turns over its new site card (if it has one). Then, each player draws cards as indicated on a new site card. Next, your opponent may play hazard cards on the company; the maximum number of hazards that may be played on a company is equal to the the size of the company (to a minimum of two). Finally, remove the old site card and each player discards or draws so that he has eight cards in his hand.
> - _Site Phase_ — One at a time, each of your companies _may_ take the following actions at its current, untapped site. The company decides to enter and explore the site. If the site has an automatic-attack, it attacks the company. The company may attempt to play one item, ally, faction, or information resource card that is "playable" at that site. A character in the company must tap to make this attempt. If the card is successfully played, tap the site.
> - _End-of-Turn Phase_ — Each player may discard one card. Then each player must draw or discard so that his hand has eight cards. 
>

## The Dragons

> This insert provides expansion rules, clarifications, and a scenario for use with both _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) and _Middle-earth: The Dragons_ (_METD_). These rules are recommended for all _METW_ games even if _METD_ is not used.

## The Lidless Eye

{: .mele }
> During the Third Age, Sauron the Dark Lord returned and threatened to enslave all of Middle-earth. However, having been defeated and almost destroyed in the Second Age, Sauron hesitated—he wanted to restore himself to full power before starting his final assault on the Free Peoples. This meant he needed to marshal overwhelming tactical and strategic resources: and, if possible, he needed to recover the lost reservoir of his vast might, The One Ring.
> 
> Sauron wanted to remain in the safety of Barad-Dur, in the center of his web of control. So his chief tools for gathering resources were his Ringwraiths the nine Nazgul. While Sauron could automatically exert control over any Nazgul, the Nazgul maintained a large amount of independence and free will—they were of little use to Sauron without it.
> 
> In _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye (MELE)_, you play one of these nine Ringwraiths, the Nazgul. Your goal is to marshal enough resources so that the Dark Lord will be confident enough to send you and your armies to launch the first blow necessary to crush the Free Peoples. Since your fellow Ringwraiths do not agree on how best to accomplish this goal (and of course none are as worthy as you), you must compete with them to be the first to gather enough forces to gain the Dark Lord's confidence. If your opponent has access to _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) cards, you will also be able to play a Ringwraith against a Wizard.
> 
> In _The Lord of the Rings_, the Witch-king of Angmar was the first Ringwraith to succeed. Sauron dispatched him and his armies to destroy Gondor. However, due to a subtle twist of fate, he fell on the brink of victory, not against a "man" of great power, but against a woman (Eowyn) and a single Hobbit (Merry).
> 
> "Dangerous forces" in _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_ are represented by _hazards_ that the players use against one another. For example, if you move a character into the Lonely Mountain, your opponent could play a Dragon card as a hazard. These hazards are not "controlled" by the Ringwraiths, but rather they represent the dangerous forces that are abroad in Middle-earth, threatening everyone, good and evil characters alike. All Ringwraiths are working to bring Sauron to full power, so conflict takes the form of hazards and direct attempts to "persuade" or "dominate" each other and each other's characters and forces, rather than the form of direct conflict.

## The White Hand

> _Middle-earth: The White Hand_ is an expansion set of 122 cards for the _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_. It is fully compatible with both _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ and _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_. In fact, this set focuses on a "Fallen-wizard" player using resources from both _The Wizards_ and _The Lidless Eye_.

> During the Third Age, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth to unite and counsel the Free Peoples in their struggles against Sauron, the Dark Lord. However, they were forbidden to dominate the peoples of Middle-earth or to match the power of Sauron with power. These five were known as “Wizards:” Alatar, Gandalf, Pallando, Radagast, and Saruman.
> 
> In _The Lord of the Rings_, Gandalf was the only Wizard to remain true to his mission. Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast “went native,” and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East to pursue their own goals. 
> 
> _Middle-earth: The White Hand_ allows you to play one of these "Fallen-wizards." As a Fallen-wizard, you can pick and choose the good and evil resources you will try to utilize—you will use any means to achieve your ends. However, you can only exert your influence and control over the weaker heroes and minions—the more powerful characters can sense your greed and weaknesses.
> 
> Each Fallen-wizards is driven by a different obsession reflected in his abilities and goals:
> 
> - The fallen **Pallando** (Master of Doom) is the master of peoples and fate. He rules and dominates peoples. He is obsessed with building his own empire and defeating Sauron by force of arms.
> - The fallen **Alatar** (Lord of the Hunt) is the master of animate nature—he is a hunter. He likes to do things personally. He is more likely to dominate individuals rather than peoples. He is obsessed with defeating Sauron by turning Middle-earth into a well-ordered game-preserve.
> - The fallen **Gandalf** (the Careworn) is the friend of peoples, fate, and Middle-earth. He manipulates peoples and their rulers rather than dominate them—he is not an empire builder. He has lost hope of defeating Sauron. He just wants to delay the Dark Lord's final victory as long as possible, and to save as many of the Free Peoples as possible.
> - The fallen **Radagast** (of the Greenwood) is the friend of animate nature. He looks at Middle-earth as a big garden with people as the gardeners. He persuades but doesn't dominate. He plans to help nature protect itself from the Dark Lord.
> - The fallen **Saruman** (of Many Colours) is the master of inanimate nature. He gathers knowledge and makes inanimate objects. He is obsessed with using his own personal power, items, and abilities to contest Sauron.
> 
> {: .note }
> > **Note:** In the terms of _ME: The Wizards_, a Wizard that has failed a corruption check by 1 or 2 has become a **Fallen-wizard** (the Wizards in _MEWH_ are all Fallen-wizards).

## The Challenge Decks

{: .mech }
> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
> 
> Welcome to the _MECCG Challenge Decks_. This box contains everything you need, except for a pair of dice, to challenge any opponent to a fun and competitive match of the _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_).
> 
> The deck is preconstructed with cards available from teh following sets of _MECCG_: _Middle-earth: The Wizards_, _Middle-earth: The Dragons_, _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_, _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_, _Middle-earth: Against the Shadow_, and _Middle-earth: The White Hand_. Also, some promitional cards printed though _The White Hand_ were used. The cards were all originally printed as common or uncommon except for 3 rares per deck. The cards were chosen to complement each other in order to achieve maximum success in play, yet be rewarding as the story of the deck unfolds. _Challenge Deck_ cards reflect published errata and clarifications.
> 
> The deck is tournament-read for the two-deck game. This is the game format presented in the Rules Summary. It observes the following Council of Lorien tournament rules: (a) 12-creature minimum; (b) 30-card resource/hazard minimum; (c) up to three Wizards/Ringwraiths allowed in the play deck; (d) Ringwraith players having +5 general influence that cannot control characters; and (e) Ringwraiths and their starting companies beginning play at Minas Morgul or Dol Guldur. If your Wizards or Ringwraith is eliminated, you do not lose the game, but rather lose five marshalling points off your final total and continue playing.
> 
> The Council of Lorien is the sanctioning body of official _MECCG_ tournament play in the United States and Canada. For more information on the COuncil and coordinating a sanctioned _MECCG_ tournament, contact ICE promotion at 1 (800) 325-0479.
> 
> The deck has 30 resources and 30 hazards, a complete complement of characters and sites for carrying out the resource strategy, and a 20 card sideboard. As per the tournament rules update in _The White Hand_, the sideboard is allowed to contain up to 30 cards. You should consider adding 10 cards to the sideboard when using this deck in a two-deck tournament, as this is certainly legal and adds to your deck's ability to react to an opponent.
> 
> After becoming familiar with your challenge deck, you may want to modify it. You can bring in more powerful cards, or you may want to vary its predictability for playing against familiar opponents. You may want to make the deck even more competitive in a two-deck tournament. For example, the following hazards can benefit almost any _Challenge Deck_: _Mouth of Sauron_, _Uvatha the Horseman_, _Adunaphel_, _Daelomin at Home_, _My Precious_, _Lure of Power_, and _Durin's Bane_. Ringwraith players should consider if Dragon factions would fit into their existing resource mix. There are 9 Dragon factions all told, each worth from 3 to 6 faction marshalling points. Some excellent resources almost any Wizard deck can integrate are: the ally _Tom Bombadil_, the faction _Woses of Old Pukel-land_, and the item _The Mithril-coat_. 
> 
> <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
> 
> In _MECCG_ you play as one of the Wizards or Ringwraiths, trying to influence the Free Peoples or Sauron into letting you lead their armies.
> 
> You control one or more companies, which are groups of characters. These companies move around Middle-earth from site to site. At the sites they can gain resources, which provide you with marshalling points (MPs). The marshalling points for a card are in the upper left-hand corner of the card. The accumulation of marshalling points is the primary way of winning the game.
> 
> During the game you may "reveal" yourself. To do this you play a Ringwraith or Wizard card. That card represents you in the game. If that card is eliminated, through combat or corruption, then you lose the game.
> 
> While your opponent is moving, you get to play hazards on his companies. These hazards represent the creatures and events your opponent must deal with while traveling in Middle-earth.

## The Balrog

{: .meba }
> <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
> 
> There are two different _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ (_MEBA_) boxes—The Shadow-deeps (reddish) and the Balrog's Host (bluish). Together, these two boxes contain at least one copy of each of the 104 _MEBA_ expansion cards. So, if you have purchased both boxes, you have a complete set of the _MEBA_ cards. 
> 
> Each _MEBA_ box contains all of the cards for a preconstructed _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_) deck—everything you need, except for a pair of dice, to challenge any opponent to a fun and competitive match of _MECCG_.
> 
> This rulesbook has four parts:
> - The specific rules for _MEBA_
> - The play tips and deck lists for the two preconstructed _MEBA_ decks
> - The _MECCG_ rules summary
> The card diagrams and Middle-earth map
> 
> <h2>SPECIFIC RULES FOR MIDDLE-EARTH: THE BALROG</h2>
> 
> This is an expansion set of over 100 cards for the _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_. While it is fully compatible with both _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ and _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_, _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ focuses on a player using resources from _The Lidless Eye_. 
> 
> The Balrog is supremely confident of his own immense personal power. After all, just like Sauron, he was one of Morgoth's chief lieutenants. The Balrog tends to rely on brute force and direct confrontation rather than more subtle approaches often used by Ringwraiths and Wizards. His goals are basic and simple—accumulate power and destroy his enemies. If he can do this, he can become a dominant power in Middle-earth—a factor to which both the Dark Lord and the Free Peoples will be forced to react.
