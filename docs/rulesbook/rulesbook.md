# RULESBOOK

The _Council of Lórien Rulesbook_ is a compilation[^compilation] of the rules for the _Middle-earth collectible card game_. It is meant to be searched.

### Typography

Text of rules that apply to **all** players with _annotations_ [^changes] of any changes. 

{: .metw }
> Rules from _Middle-earth: The Wizards Limited_ or _Unlimited_.  

{: .mele }
> Rules from _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_.  

{: .mewh }
> Rules from _Middle-earth: The White Hand_.   

{: .meba }
> Rules from _Middle-earth: The Balrog_.

_Text added by the Counsel of Lórien._

[^compilation]: This is a compilation, not a rewrite. _Aragorn's Rulesguide for Hasty Hobbits_ is a rewrite of the rules for beginners.
[^changes]: The change and the source of the change are explained in footnotes.
