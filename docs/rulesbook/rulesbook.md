# RULESBOOK

The _Council of Lórien Rulesbook_ is a compilation of rules for the _Middle-earth collectible card game_. It includes the rules including the rules from _The Wizards_, _The Wizards Unlimited_, _The Dragons_, _Dark Minions_, _The Lidless Eye_, _Against the Shadow_, _The White Hand_, _The Balrog_, the _Challenge Decks Rules Summary_, and version 15 of the _Collected Rulings File_. It is a ***compilation*** with annotations, not a rewrite. Yet, some additional structure and formatting was needed to arrange the pieces and certain rules have been superceded or changed.

### Typography

_Text added by the **Counsel of Lórien**, chief archivist._

Text of general rules that apply to **all** players with _annotations_ [^1] of any **changes**.
