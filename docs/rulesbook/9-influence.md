You  have  a pool of general influence. Your characters and Wizard have  direct
influence.  These two forms of influence can control and affect characters  (see
pages 14-15) and factions.
Bringing an Ally into Play
 You  can  automatically  bring  an  ally into  play  by  tapping  one  of  your
characters.  The  character must be at the site indicated on  the  ally's  card.
Every  ally is controlled by the character that brought it into play;  i.e.,  it
must  be  placed under and remain with that character's card. An ally  does  not
count  against  its  controlling character's direct influence  or  your  general
influence.
Bringing a Faction into Play
 In  order to play a faction card, you must tap one of your characters  that  is
at  the  "site" indicated on the faction's card. Then you must make an influence
check. Make a roll (2D6), add your character's unused direct influence, and  add
any  appropriate modifications (from the faction card and from any  other  cards
played). All modification cards must be played before making the roll (2D6).
 If  the modified result is greater than the value required on the faction card,
you  place  the  faction in your play area. Otherwise, you discard  the  faction
card.  Once a faction is brought into play, it is not controlled by any specific
character and it does not count against general or direct influence.
                                       
 Your  unused  general  influence is equal to 20  minus  the  sum  of  the  mind
attributes  of  your non-follower characters in play (i.e., do  not  count  your
followers).
 A  character's  unused  direct  influence is  equal  to  his  direct  influence
attribute  minus the sum of the mind attributes of his followers. All characters
have  a direct influence attribute of at least zero, so any character has unused
direct influence of at least zero.
 Note:  In  the  Standard Game, direct influence can be  used  to  attempt  to
 interfere   with  your  opponent's  control  of  his  characters,  followers,
 factions, allies, and items.
 
  Influence  is  the  only  way that your characters  can  directly  affect  your
opponent's  resources.  During  your site  phase,  one  and  only  one  of  your
characters  may  tap  to  attempt  to influence  away  one  of  your  opponent's
characters, followers, allies, factions, or items. This may only take  place  if
the  influencing character and the target of the influence are at the same site.
If  you  successfully influence the target, it is discarded. In some cases,  you
may  reveal  an  identical card and attempt to play it (i.e., he  convinces  the
target to join his side).
 Such  an influence attempt may not be made on the first turn, and a Wizard  may
not make such an attempt on the turn he is revealed.
Influencing an Opponent's Character
 To  attempt to influence one of your opponent's non-Wizard characters you  must
make an influence check. You make a roll (2D6) and:
 Add the influencing character's unused direct influence.
 Subtract your opponent's unused general influence points.
 Subtract the result of a roll (2D6) made by your opponent .
 Add any other modifications (from cards and special abilities). All
 modification cards must be played before making the roll.
 If  the modified result is greater than the target's mind attribute, the target
character  card  and  all of the non-follower cards he controls  are  discarded.
Otherwise, nothing happens.
 If  you  reveal  an identical character card from your hand before  making  the
roll  for the influence check, the target character's mind attribute is  treated
as  if  it  were  zero.  If the attempt is unsuccessful, you  must  discard  the
character  card  you  revealed. If such an influence check  is  successful,  the
target  character  and  his non-follower cards are discarded  and  the  revealed
character card can be immediately played (appearing at the same site). In  order
to play this character, you must have enough unused general influence to control
him  or  an  influencing  character at the same site  must  have  enough  direct
influence.
Influencing an Opponent's Follower
 To  influence  an  opponent's follower, you must make  an  influence  check  as
outlined above. However, the result is also modified by subtracting the  "unused
direct influence" of the follower's controlling character.
Influencing an Opponent's Faction
 To  influence  an  opponent's  faction, you must make  an  influence  check  as
outlined above. However, the following exceptions apply:
 Instead of a mind attribute, the influence check uses the value usually
 required to bring the faction into play (as given on the faction's card).
 The influence check is modified by any of the faction's applicable "Standard
 Modifications" (as given on the faction's card).
 Revealing an identical faction card allows you to play that card if the
 influence check is successful.
 You  may  only  influence one of your opponent's factions  if  the  influencing
character is at the site where the faction was played.
Influencing an Opponent's Ally
 To  influence an opponent's ally, you must make an influence check as  outlined
above. However, the following exceptions apply:
 Instead  of  the  controlling character's mind attribute, the  influence  check
 uses the ally's mind attribute.
 The  result is also modified by the "unused direct influence" of the  character
 controlling the ally.
 Revealing an identical ally card reduces the ally's mind attribute to zero  and
 allows you to play the card if the influence check is successful.
Influencing an Opponent's Item
 To  influence an opponent's item, you must make an influence check as  outlined
above. However, the following exceptions apply:
 The mind attribute of the character controlling the item is used.
 The  result  is  also modified by subtracting the "unused direct influence"  of
 the item's controlling character.
 You  must  reveal an identical item card in order to make an influence  attempt
 on  an  item  (i.e.,  you are attempting to convince the controlling  character
 that  the  item would be more useful to the cause of the free peoples  in  your
 hands).  If the influence check is successful, you may play your card with  the
 character that made the influence check.
