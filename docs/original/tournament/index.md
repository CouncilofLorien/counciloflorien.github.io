# TOURNAMENT POLICIES

Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) published rules and regulations for sanctioned tournament play as Council of Lórien Tournament Policies. 

These tournament policies are _official_ in that they were authored or authorized by Coleman Charlton and Mike Reynolds, the Designers and Developers of _Middle-earth CCG_ at Iron Crown Enterprises. The gameplay rules in the Council of Lórien Tournament Policy Number 3 are not outdated. However, many of the regulations are outdated as ICE is no longer sanctioning tournaments.

ICE provided supplemental rules and regulations for sanction tournament play:

 - [News from The Council of Lórien, Issue Number One](/original/tournament/policy-1/) (May 1996)
 - [News from The Council of Lórien, Issue Number Two](/original/tournament/policy-2/) (29 October 1996)
 - [Council of Lórien Tournament Policy Number 3](/original/tournament/policy-3/) (9 May 1998)
