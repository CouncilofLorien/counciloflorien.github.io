# Championships Format

This is the format for the 1999 Council of Lorien North American Championships, including the non-santioned Type 1.5 tournament held for semi-finals invitees. Unless otherwise specified here, the tournaments will be run under current Council of Lorien rules, using Collected Rulings File #15. All tournaments will be run by Craig  Ichabod  O Brien, the MECCG Series Editor.

## Pairings and Tie-Breakers

For all of the tournaments except the finals, the first round will be paired based on ratings. The players will be arranged in order of ratings and then split in half. The top player from the top half will play the top player from the bottom half, and so on down. Subsequent rounds will be paired based on tournament points as usual.

Pairing the first round by ratings will allow to use a different set of tie-breakers that will better judge the strength of the players compared to the field as a whole. The first tie-breaker will be Sum of Opponent's Scores, which is the sum of the tournament points scored in the tournament by each opponent of the player in question. The second tie-breaker will be Cumulative Score, which is the sum of the player s total tournament points after each round. If there is still a tie, the usual tie-breakers of Head-to-Head and Number of Wins will be used.

The finals will be a four person round robin tournament. The player with the most tournament points will be declared the winner. Ties will be broken using head to head results. In the unlikely event that there is still a three way tie for champion, the player who placed highest in the semi-finals will be declared the winner and champion.

## Open

The Open tournament will be held on Friday at 10 am, and any player who has not already qualified for the semi-finals may enter. The tournament will be two-deck general opponent format. The pairngs will be done by swiss system, where each player plays every round. Players without Council of Lorien ratings will be paired as if they had a rating of 500.

The top 5 players from the Open will qualify for the Semis on Saturday. Other players who finish in the top half of the Open may be allowed to play in the Semis on Saturday, depending on how many players with invitations show up.

Each player is required to submit a deck list on one or more letter-sized pieces of paper.

## Semis

The Semis (or Semi-Finals) will be held on Saturday at 10 am, and are invitation only. A list of invited players will be posted seperately, and the top players from the Open will be invited as detailed above. The Semis will be run with Swiss pairings, where each player plays every round. The format will be two-deck general opponent.

Each player is required to submit a deck list on one or more letter-sized pieces of paper.

The top four players from the Semis will be invited to the finals on Sunday.


## Finals

The Finals will be held on Sunday at 10 am. The format will be two-deck general opponent. It will be a three round, Round Robin tournament, were each player plays every other player. The player with the top tournament point total will be declared the North American Champion, and all four players will recieve invitations to this winter s Council of Endor World Championships.

Each player is required to submit a deck list on one or more letter-sized pieces of paper.

# Type 1.5

There will be special non-sanctioned tournament held on Friday, for those with invitiations to the Semis. As some of you may know, we are currently in the process of revising MECCG, and this tournament will showcase some of the new rules we are currently playtesting for the revision. The tournament will be run as a Wizard only tournament
(hazards and hero resources from any set may be used), with the following additional rules:

 - Active Conditions: Characters may not be used as active conditions during the movement/hazard or site phases unless they are in the currently phasing company.
 - Calling the End Game: The End Game (or the Free Council) may be called by either player if they have at least 20 MPs. The End Game is automatically called after both play decks have been exhausted (at the end of the turn).
 - Characters: Character MPs are ignored (except for negative MPs). You may bring a character into play at a Haven or his home site, regardless of the position of your Wizard. To bring a character into play, you must have enough influence available to control the character.
 - Character Draft: The draft is no longer simultaneous. Before the draft, dice are rolled by each player. The high roller choose whether to draft the first character or take the first turn. Once the first drafter is determined, players draft in alternation until the normal requirements are met. Wizards may be drafted, counting as 0 mind characters.
 - Company Limit: You may only have two companies. Characters with Await the Advent of Allies played on them do not count against the two company limit.
 - Discards: All players must dicard face up.
 - Extra Strikes: Extra strikes now give a -1 to prowess *and* a -1 to body. No character s body may be lowered to less than 6 by excess strikes.
 - Gold Rings: You may tap a sage to test a gold ring. If you test a ring in this fashion, results indicating the One Ring are ignored.
 - Influence Attempts: You may not make an influence attempt against an opponent's resource unless you have a copy of that resource in your hand, and reveal it for the influence attempt.
 - Minor Items: One minor item may be played after entering any site, from the sideboard, hand, or discard pile. Tap a character to play the minor item on that character. Minor items that may be discarded for an effect may not be played from the discard pile, and Star-glass may not be played from the sideboard.
 - Movement: You may not use starter movement, and you may only move three regions per turn.
 - Reserve Pile: There will be a reserve pile for each player. All sideboarded cards, and any other cards that would normally be shuffled into the deck, go into the reserve pile. Your free discard during the end of turn phase may go into the reserve pile if you wish. After your turn, shuffle your reserve pile into your deck (as your opponent is planning his turn).
 - Sideboarding: You may not sideboard into the discard pile or into the play deck. Any effect that normally allows sideboarding a card into the play deck puts that card in the reserve pile instead. When you exhaust your play deck, you may put five cards from the sideboard into the reserve pile before reshuffling. However, you may not remove cards from your deck at that time. Two new ways to sideboard are added. If a company enters a site and plays no resources, you may tap one character in that company to sideboard one resource into the reserve pile. If an opponent s company moves and you play no hazards on them, then you may sideboard one hazard into the reserve pile.
 - Starting Site: You may start at Rivendell, Lorien, Minas Tirith, or Edhellond.
 - Weakest Link Method: This will not be used. Ties will stand, and each player will gain 3 tournament points.
