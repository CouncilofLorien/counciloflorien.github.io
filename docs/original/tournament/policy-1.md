As of May 1996, the following policy is in place for official Council tournaments. Each tournament has a tournament coordinator. This is the person in charge of running the tournament. In the text below, "tournament coordinator" means the coordinator or any staff member assigned by the coordinator to assist him or her.

The Tournament Format
Games not in the rulesbook

GENERAL
1) Two Player Games Only-All Council matches will be between two players. Multi-player and solitaire tournaments will not be official Council events.
2) Accommodations-Players must be provided with reasonably comfortable accommodations. The playing environment must be clean and reasonably free of elements that pose a threat to the physical integrity of each player's cards.
3) Using Maps-If standard rules are being used, an appropriate map of the regions of Middle-earth collectible card game can be used to depict region movement (instead of using actual region cards). Certain regions, which appear to be adjacent on the map, in fact, are not listed as adjacent on the appropriate region cards (e.g., Rohan and Dagorlad, Cardolan and Lindon). Such regions are not considered adjacent, even when a map is used for region movement.
4) Character Draft-Starting characters will be determined by draft as per the guidelines printed on page 55 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion. This method is called the Character Draft (and is detailed below).

Character Draft
Each Player selects up to 10 characters to put into his or her pool of potential starting characters. This happens before characters are selected for the play deck. Each player reveals his or her first choice for a starting character simultaneously with opponent. If this character is duplicated by opponent's selection, both characters are set aside (this character may not appear in either player's starting company). Each player then selects a second character to reveal (but not a character revealed earlier). Each unduplicated revealed character goes into its player's starting company. Each player continues this process until one of the following occurs: the player has 5 characters in his or her company, the total Mind stats of that player's starting characters is 20, the player has exhausted his or her pool of 10 potential starting characters, or the player decides to stop revealing characters (i.e., he or she is satisfied with the starting company). Note that when one player stops, the other player continues revealing characters until one of the four conditions is met. A player may not reveal a character that would bring the total Mind stats of all of his or her starting characters above 20.
In his or her play deck, each player may now assign up to 10 characters, and this may include any unrevealed or duplicated (set aside) characters from his or her pool of starting characters.
Allowing players to introduce characters in this fashion minimizes matches where each player starts with very few characters because of multiple duplications.
5) Free Council Ties-The Weakest Link Method, as printed on page 57 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion (and detailed below), is used to break Free Council ties.

The Weakest Link Method
If both players have an equal number of marshalling points after the Free Council has resolved (i.e., there is a tie), add one corruption point to each non-Wizard character in play. Each character must make another corruption check. Marshalling points are recounted and victory is awarded to the player with the most marshalling points. If there is still a tie, add one more corruption point to each non-Wizard character and each makes another corruption check. Again, assess marshalling points to see if a winner emerges. If not, continue adding one corruption point, making corruption checks, and reassessing marshalling points until a winner emerges.
If, in the unlikely event, all non-Wizard characters in play are corrupted away by this method, and there is still a tie, then players proceed with one of the two following methods, depending upon the tournament structure:
· with the Swiss System, where ties can be conveniently represented in the tournament structure, the game ends in a tie and each player receives 3 tournament points (see The Tournament Format below); and
· with elimination tournaments, each player rolls dice to determine a winner-highest roller wins.
Note that the Weakest Link Method simulates who will most likely fail in the final struggle against Sauron. The characters are not actually being corrupted at the Free Council. Instead, the Free Council is "peering into the heart and soul" of each character and assessing him or her.
6) Simultaneous Elimination-If each player's Wizard is eliminated by the corruption checks made before the Free Council (or on the same round of The Weakest Link Method), players proceed with one of the two following methods, depending upon the tournament structure:

· with the Swiss System, where ties can be conveniently represented in the tournament structure, the game ends in a tie and each player receives 3 tournament points (see The Tournament Format below); and
· with elimination tournaments, each player rolls dice to determine a winner-highest roller wins.
7) To determine which player's characters make their corruption checks first when going before the Free Council (and possibly carried into The Weakest Link Method), each player makes a dice roll. Rerolling ties, the player who rolls highest chooses which player's characters go first. This rule only has a significant application in limited cases, such as when a Traitor card is in play.
8) A 10 creature minimum is required in each play deck's hazard mix. Creatures that are also events count as only half a creature towards this limit (rounding down). Such creatures include the Nazgûl, Mouth of Sauron, and Shelob. Sideboards have no such creature restrictions.
9) Only one of each unique card and a maximum of three of any other cards can be included in a player's play deck, sideboard, and starting cards collectively. As an exception, a player may include 2 of the same Wizard in his or her play deck. No Wizards are allowed in the sideboard.
10) Players and the coordinator should make certain that, for standard rules games, all of the marshalling point modifications printed on page 50 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Unlimited Edition rulesbook and on page 32 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion are properly accounted for. These modifications are to be interpreted in the order they are printed.
Rules of etiquette
11) Deck Construction-The cards used in deck building may be from any edition or expansion of the Middle-earth® collectible card game (including foreign translations and official promotional cards). The mechanics of any given card will be determined from the most recent English printing (as well as from official errata and the official FAQ). No proxy cards will be allowed. Cards from any particular expansion may only be used in Council events after a minimum time of 30 days following their official retail release has passed. As an exception, cards from Middle-earth: The Dragons will be allowed 14 days after its official release. Middle-earth: The Dragons is currently scheduled to be released June 7, 1996; its cards would, thus, be available for Council events June 21, 1996.
12) Deck Integrity-Each player is required to use the same play deck, sideboard, and pool of starting characters for the entire tournament. No card substitutions are allowed between games. A player must start each game with the same cards in his or her play deck, sideboard, and pool of starting characters as he or she started the tournament. The tournament coordinator may choose to require each player to submit a written copy of all cards in his or her play deck, sideboard, and pool of starting characters before playing (spot checks may be used at each round to ensure decks are legal). The coordinator must post such a request at least 24 hours prior to the tournament start.
13) Marked Cards-A player may petition the tournament coordinator to disallow a non-location card from an opponent's cards, if the offending card has a distinguishing mark, tear, or fold visible on its generic side.
14) Protective Sleeves-A player may play with his or her cards in protective sleeves unless the tournament coordinator requires the cards to be taken out of the sleeves. An opponent may petition the tournament coordinator to require that a player remove his or her cards from their protective sleeves, if the opponent reasonably believes that one of the following rules is being violated.

· Each of a player's cards must be in the same make of protective sleeve.
· Each card must be oriented the same way with respect to the opening of the sleeve.
· No distinguishing marks or inconsistent degree of wear is allowed on individual sleeves.
· Only one card is allowed in each sleeve.
15) Shuffling-All deck shuffling must be made above the edge of the table (in clear view of your opponent). After you shuffle your cards at least three times, your opponent will be allowed to shuffle your cards and/or cut your deck up to three times. An opponent must shuffle a player's cards in a manner that will not damage the cards physical integrity. It is highly recommended that an opponent shuffle a player's cards by dealing them out in some number of face-down stacks.
16) Conventions of Play-Each player and opponent should make sure that any conventions used for card play (including denoting play decks and discard piles) are obvious and agreed upon by both players.
17) Finishing Games-When a game is finished, both players should leave their cards on the playing surface and notify the tournament coordinator that their game is finished. Players do not pick up their cards until the tournament coordinator says so. The tournament coordinator has the option of observing the game's final position and tallying the game's score and tournament points to be awarded. The tournament coordinator may announce that, if both players agree on their game, they can pick up their cards and report their game's results to the coordinator without inspection.
18) Players that Stall-If an opponent is believed to be stalling for purposeful gain, or if an opponent is believed to be stalling through a lack of respect for or sensitivity to the time limit, the player can petition the tournament coordinator to observe the game. If the coordinator observes that the opponent is stalling more than what is reasonable and necessary, the coordinator can call the game in favor of the non-stalling player. In a Swiss System format (see below under The Tournament Format), the player receives the maximum tournament points for the capability of his or her deck. The tournament coordinator would have to make a judgment as to what the deck's capability is. There are exactly two choices: the deck is either capable of destroying The One Ring [must have a ring test (not counting Ringlores or Tests of Lore) and three Precious Gold Rings in the starting play deck, and must have The One Ring and either the Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate and Gollum in the starting play deck or sideboard]; or the deck is only capable of the maximum marshalling points win. Note that a player receives tournament points for a ratio of his or her marshalling points with the opponent's if time is called.
19) Players Dropping Out-A player should be discouraged from dropping out of a game before the game has reached its natural conclusion. A player is expected to drop out of the tournament between rounds if he or she believes he or she will be unable to complete the following round's game. Certain emergencies cannot be avoided though, and a player may be forced to drop out of a game. If a player drops out of a game, he or she drops out of the tournament, cannot reenter the tournament in a later round, and receives no consideration for prizes or tournament ranking. If a player drops out of the game, the player concedes the game and the opponent receives the win. In a Swiss System format (see below under The Tournament Format), the opponent receives the maximum tournament points for the capability of his or her deck. The tournament coordinator would have to make a judgment as to what the deck's capability is. There are exactly two choices: the deck is either capable of destroying The One Ring [must have a ring test (not counting Ringlores or Tests of Lore) and three Precious Gold Rings in the starting play deck, and must have The One Ring and either the Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate and Gollum in the starting play deck or sideboard]; or the deck is only capable of the maximum marshalling points win.
20) Rules Violations during Play-Rules violations will probably occur in tournaments, especially now in the younger days of the Middle-earth® collectible card game. It is suggested that these violations not be policed or worried about until a player involved notes it. At that point in the game, the correct rule is adopted. Previous violations are not affected or retroactively corrected. For example, if a player chooses Sting (a unique minor item) for his starting company, and his opponent notices after the first turn of the game that unique minor items may not be chosen for starting companies, do not replace Sting at this point. If the opponent noticed the violation before either player had taken a first turn, the offending player must replace Sting with a non-unique minor item. The tournament coordinator may choose to immediately correct any rules violations brought to his or her attention.
21) Cheating-If a player cheats, he or she is immediately ejected from the event. In a Swiss System format (see below under The Tournament Format), an opponent receives the maximum tournament points for the capability of his or her deck. The tournament coordinator would have to make a judgment as to what the deck's capability is. There are exactly two choices: the deck is either capable of destroying The One Ring [must have a ring test (not counting Ringlores or Tests of Lore) and three Precious Gold Rings in the starting play deck, and must have The One Ring and either the Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate and Gollum in the starting play deck or sideboard]; or the deck is only capable of the maximum marshalling points win.


CLARIFICATIONS AND RULINGS
22) An attack cannot be actively declared while another attack is being carried out. In the case that an attack is passively declared while another attack is being carried out, the new attack is carried out immediately after the present one is concluded. As an example, a Traitor card can cause an attack to be passively declared, i.e., the attack comes about through no direct active decision of either player.
23) If a player's Wizard is discarded with Sacrifice of Form, that player may not reveal any different Wizards, and the opponent may not reveal the discarded Wizard.
24) A player may not play any resources during the opponent's turn. Additionally, a player may not actively engage any resource or character effect during the opponent's turn (e.g., a player may not tap a Palantír during the opponent's turn). A player may not play any hazards and may not actively engage any hazard permanent-events, etc. outside of the opponent's movement/hazard phase.
25) A player may not target an opponent's characters, companies, items, followers, etc. with his or her own resources. Of course, resource long-events and other cards which do not target and have global effects will affect opponent's cards.
26) A card's text takes precedence if it contradicts a rule of the game (or these rules).
27) Certain cards, effects, and/or rules allow a player to search for cards and add them to his or her hand, play deck, or discard pile outside of the normal sequence of play (i.e., in addition to filling out the hand and drawing cards when a company moves). A player may or may not be required to reveal some or all of the identity of such manipulated cards. Given below is a list of all such effects and cards included in Middle-earth: The Wizards and the official ruling on how the implementing player must reveal the manipulated cards, if at all. If multiple cards are manipulated at a time (e.g., exchanging cards with the sideboard when a play deck is exhausted), the player must declare the number of cards so manipulated. [Key: RE-the manipulated card must be revealed to an opponent; RR-enough of the manipulated card's face must be revealed to show opponent that it is a resource/character; RH-enough of the manipulated card's face must be revealed to show opponent that it is a hazard; NR-the manipulated card need not be revealed to opponent.]
Bringing a resource/character in from the sideboard to the play deck or discard pile (by tapping a Wizard)-RR
Bringing a hazard in from the sideboard to the play deck or discard pile (by tapping a Nazgûl permanent-event or by option when op-ponent's Wizard is revealed-see below)-RH
Exchanging cards from the sideboard with the play deck when a player exhausts his or her deck-NR
Far-sight-RE
Lordly Presence-NR
Lucky Search-RE
Reforging-RE
Vilya-RR
Favor of the Valar-NR
Palantír of Annúminas-RE
Palantír of Minas Tirith-NR
Palantír of Orthanc-NR
Dwarven Rings (all, except of Durin's Tribe)-RE
Mouth of Sauron-RH
Ûvatha the Horseman-RE
The Nazgûl Are Abroad-RE
28) All rulings from the FAQ (compiled by Craig "Ichabod" O'Brien) given on ICE's WEB page at "http://www.ironcrown.com"are official rulings for use with Council events.


ADDITIONAL RULES
In addition to these guidelines, a few rules not presented in the METW rulesbook take effect for tournament play immediately. These rules are presented in the expansion Middle-earth: The Dragons.
29) Removing Corruption Cards-A character may choose to ignore the restriction that he or she tap to remove a corruption card (as printed on a corruption card), and suffer a -3 penalty to the dice roll to remove it. This means a character can remain untapped to remove a corruption card and modify his roll by -3. The character can remove a corruption card when already tapped (or wounded) and modify his roll by -3. A character may only attempt to remove each corruption card once per turn if he or she ignores the tapping restriction to do so.
30) Larger Sideboard-The sideboard (which is not used with starter rules) has been increased by 5 cards for all standard rules game formats. This means, for example, that in a standard rules 1-deck and 2-deck game, the sideboard must contain 20 cards.
31) Accessing Hazards in Sideboard-A player can access hazard cards in his or her sideboard when the opponent's Wizard is in play. A player must do this at the end of the opponent's untap phase. Specifically, the player may either bring up to 5 hazard cards from the sideboard into the discard pile, or 1 hazard card from the sideboard into the play deck (if at least 5 cards are in the play deck). In either case, the hazard limit against all of the opponent's companies this turn is halved, rounded up.


THE TOURNAMENT FORMAT
As of May 1996, there is no one official tournament format. Tournament coordinators have the freedom to choose a tournament format that best suits their needs and the needs of their players.
Swiss System (the predicted standard Council format)
The Council of Lórien suggests adopting the Swiss System format as a general tournament format. This tournament format allows the success of each player to be determined by a total of tournament points awarded from the play of several games, thereby decreasing the deterministic role of luck in each game. It does not make a player's fate in the tournament hinge on each game played. It is likely that, when enough data is gathered from tournaments across the globe, The Council of Lórien will require all official Council tournaments to follow a Swiss System format.
The Swiss System format can be adopted for any of the actual types of games being run (two-deck standard rules, sealed deck starter rules, scenario, etc.). The guidelines below are assuming a game type using the Free Council will be run. This is as opposed to a Resource/Character tournament; see the special section below for specific suggestions on running a Resource/Character tournament. Here are the basics of the Swiss System tournament structure as The Council of Lórien suggests it be adopted:
Number of rounds-A Swiss System tournament is comprised of a certain number of rounds as dictated by the number of participants in the tournament.
2 players	1 round*
3 - 4 players	2 rounds*
5 - 8 players	3 rounds
9 - 16 players	4 rounds
17 - 32 players	5 rounds
33 - 64 players	6 rounds
65 - 128 players	7 rounds
129 + players	8 rounds

* [cannot be an official Council event]

Each player may participate and play (unless a bye is given) in each round if he or she desires.

Awarding Byes-For each round, it must be determined if an even or odd number of players are participating. If an odd number are participating, one player is given a "bye". The player given the bye does not play a game that round. If a bye needs to be given for the first round, the tournament coordinator randomly chooses a player from all players. This player is given a number of tournament points reflecting a win (6 tournament points, see below). If a bye needs to be given for any later rounds, the tournament coordinator randomly chooses one player from the group of players having the lowest tournament point totals. This player is given a number of tournament points reflecting a minimal win (3 tournament points, see below). After awarding one player a bye, an even number of players will remain to play in the round. It is encouraged that the tournament coordinator take steps to avoid giving a bye for the first round.

With an even number of players participating in a round, players are paired off. Paired players play one game within a time limit. Specific game rules and time limits are dictated by the game type of the tournament (two-deck standard rules, sealed deck starter rules, scenario, etc.).

For the first round only, players are paired off randomly (i.e., each player has zero tournament points).

Pairing Players-For each round after the first round, each player is paired off with another player with the exact same total of tournament points. A tournament coordinator begins pairing each round with the group of players who have the highest total tournament points. When pairings are being determined, choose a player at random from the pool of available players with the same total of tournament points, and then choose the player with whom he or she is paired. If more than one eligible player exists with whom a player may be paired, the second player is determined randomly from all eligible players. If no eligible players exist with whom a player may be paired, the player is paired with a player with the next lowest total tournament points (chosen randomly if more than one player exists with the next lowest total).

Each player is awarded a certain number of tournament points based upon the result of each game he or she plays. When a game is finished, both players should leave their cards on the playing surface and notify the tournament coordinator that their game is finished. The tournament coordinator would then have the option of observing the game's final position and tallying the game's score and tournament points to be awarded.

Upon completing a game, a player must notify the tournament coordinator if he or she intends not to participate in the next round. A player can feel free to drop out of the tournament after any round, but the player would then be ineligible to reenter the tournament and ineligible to receive any prize or ranking consideration.

A total of accumulated tournament points is kept for each player. The winner of the tournament is the player with the most tournament points when all rounds of the tournament are completed. Runners-up can also be determined at that time by the ranks of their tournament point totals.

Tournament Points-A player is awarded a number of tournament points for the following game results (only one result can apply to each player at the conclusion of each of his or her games):

Destroying The One Ring (i.e., successfully playing Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate)-10 (in sealed deck game), 8 (in a single-deck game), 7 (in a two-deck, three-deck, or campaign game);
Defeating opponent with a Marshalling Points Ratio of 2 or greater-6;
Opponent's Wizard being eliminated-6;
Receiving a bye-6 for the first round, 3 for a later round;
Defeating opponent with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 2 but greater than or equal to 1.5-5;
Defeating opponent with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 1.5 but greater than one-4;
Defeating opponent with the Weakest Link Method of breaking ties at the Free Council-3;
Achieving a tie as per items 4 and 5 under GENERAL at the top of this document-3;
Losing with the Weakest Link Method of breaking ties at the Free Council-2;
Losing the game otherwise-0.
Tournament Point Ties-When all rounds are completed, it is possible that more than one player will have the same highest tournament point total (i.e., the leaders will be tied). Before the tournament begins, the tournament coordinator posts how this situation will be resolved. The three options are:

The following menu of tie-breaking criteria is followed. Each tied participant is in contention until a criterion is resolved that takes him or her out of contention. Those leading participants removed from contention are relegated to the tier of runners-up (and possibly could face another series of tie-breaking criteria-see below). The coordinator resolves the list of criteria in the order given, establishing each player removed from contention, until one player is left in contention, or until the entire list of criteria is resolved and a tie still exists (see below for this case).
Head-to-Head. Tally the number of losses of each tied player from all games played with any other tied players. The players with the fewest total head-to-head losses stay in contention. All other players are out of contention.
Destroying the One Ring. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game by successfully playing Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate (see Tournament Points method 1). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.
Highest MP Ratio and Eliminating Opponent's Wizard. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game with a Marshalling Points Ratio of 2 or greater (see Tournament Points method 2) and by the opponent's Wizard being eliminated (see Tournament Points method 3). The players with the most wins in these manners are in contention. All other players are out of contention.
Next MP Ratio. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 2 but greater than or equal to 1.5 (see Tournament Points method 5). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.
Lowest MP Ratio. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 1.5 but greater than one (see Tournament Points method 6). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.
Weakest Link Method Win. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game by the Weakest Link Method as a result of a tie at the Free Council (see Tournament Points method 7). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.
Receiving a Bye. Tally the number of times each player still in contention received a bye (see Tournament Points method 4). The players with the most byes are in contention. All other players are out of contention.
If more than one player is still in contention after criterion VII is resolved, these players are considered tied once again. They tournament coordinator either invokes option (ii) or (iii), as he or she has posted.
Note that in the future, when a national ranking system is established, one of the tie-breaking criteria with be the collective strength of opponents faced.

Playoff rounds are held. The playoff rounds are formatted in the same manner as the tournament. See the Number of Rounds note above regarding the number of rounds to be played.
No tie breaker actions are taken, and each tied participant is recognized as co-champion. The pre-determined prizes for the number of top finishers equal to the number of co-champions should be divided up and awarded evenly amongst the co-champions.
It is recommended that the following exact policy for breaking ties be used, and, thus, declared before the tournament starts:

"If multiple players are tied with the most tournament points after all rounds of the regular Swiss System are complete, the menu of tie-breaking criteria will be invoked. After this, if more than one player remains in contention, a playoff of Swiss System rounds will be held amongst the players still in contention."

We presently believe that the policy in the preceding paragraph will become the sole official method of handling ties for the lead at the end of regular rounds. If multiple players are tied in a lower tier, the previously mentioned guidelines also apply. Replacing the concept of players carrying the most points with players tied carrying the same number of points. Resolving ties in the lower tiers to determine the rankings of the runners-up may be required in future Council tournaments.
The tie-breaking policy requires that tournament coordinators keep a running record of each player's opponent each round, result types each round, as well as tournament point results each round. See sample player's tournament card included with the tournament packet from the Council of Lórien.

Time Limits-Each game has a time limit that depends on the type of game being played. The time limit is the amount of time allowed for the play of games. A tournament coordinator needs to consider an additional 15 minutes or so between rounds for administrative tasks. Also, a coordinator needs to consider an amount of start-up time (20 minutes or so).
single-deck game starter rules	45 minutes
single-deck game standard rules	45 minutes
two-deck game	1 hour and 15 minutes
three-deck game	2 hours
campaign game	3 hours
sealed deck game starter rules	45 minutes*
sealed deck game standard rules	45 minutes*
resource/character scenario game	1 hour*
* See the descriptions of the different games below for further information.

A tournament coordinator will have an official time keeping device. He or she should announce the time 5 minutes before final time will be called. When the time limit is reached according to the official time keeping device, play of each game continues until: the player who went second in the game finishes a turn (i.e., both players play the same number of turns); or until the Free Council is called normally according to the rules. After the player who went second finishes his or her turn, the Free Council begins automatically, regardless of Marshalling Point totals.

Marshalling Point Ratios-If, at the Free Council after the final Marshalling Point (MP) totals have been tallied (including all standard rules interpretations), one player has more MPs than the opponent, that player wins. The opponent looses and receives zero tournament points. The winner receives either 4, 5, or 6 tournament points depending upon the ratio of his MP total to the opponent's (see above). To determine a winner's MP ratio, divide the winner's total MPs by the loser's MPs. A loser with zero or negative MPs automatically gives the winner 6 tournament points (and a method c win).

If, at the Free Council after the final MP totals have been tallied (including all standard rules interpretations), both players have the same number of MPs (i.e., they are tied), use the Weakest Link Method to determine a winner and a loser (see above). The winner receives 3 tournament points; the looser receives 2.

Elimination
See page 56 of Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion for a suggested modified single-elimination format. Normal single-, and double-elimination are acceptable and may be used for now for official Council events. Note that it is expected that the Council of Lórien will adopt the Swiss System format for all official events.


GAMES NOT IN THE RULESBOOK
The Sealed Deck Game
For a sealed deck game tournament, each player receives a starter deck and three booster packs. Each player is allowed 45 minutes to construct a deck for a one-deck game. It will have to determined if standard or starter rules are being used by the tournament coordinator. It should be noted that on average, seven cards (not counting region cards) from each player's set of cards will not be playable at all. Players should be aware of this extra baggage when constructing their decks. If a player does not have 25 playable hazards or resources, he should play with all that he does have, and still play with a minimum of 25 of the other.

The Resource/Character Scenario Game
The description below is adopted to the Swiss System format. For suggestions for running the resource/character game within an elimination format, see pages 56 and 57 of Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion.
It is recommended that resource/character scenarios be considered by a tournament coordinator who has the means of communicating to all players in advance what the pool of scenarios will be for the tournament. It is suggested that the coordinator post (in advance) three resource/character scenarios that will be used for the tournament. Each player comes to the tournament with a deck constructed for his or her chosen scenario.

Present Official Scenarios-Presently, the three scenarios for official Council event tournaments are:

Resource/character scenario game tournaments can be run within the same tournament Swiss System structure as the other Free Council games (which are the games presented in the rulesbook). Each player attempts to complete the victory conditions of his or her chosen scenario instead of playing for the Free Council. After starting characters are revealed, each player must announce to the opponent which scenario he or she has chosen. The opponent then knows what victory conditions the player is trying to achieve.

Time Limit-For a Resource/Character Scenario tournament game, time is called after one hour . If, at this point, no player has achieved the victory conditions for his or her scenario, the player who currently is taking his or her turn finishes the turn. If the opponent did not have the first turn, the opponent then takes one final turn (i.e., both players get the same number of turns). Assuming in the interim no player achieves the victory conditions for his or her chosen scenario, the winner is the player who achieves the higher "rank" as indicated by his or her specific scenario.

Ties-If both players have achieved the same "rank" as indicated by the specific scenarios, the players tie. Each receives 3 tournament points.

Tournament Points-A player is awarded a number of tournament points in a resource/character scenario game for the following game results:
Achieving the victory conditions of his or her chosen scenario-6
Achieving the higher rank at the game's end-4
Tying-3
Losing with a lower rank at the game's end-2
Losing if opponent achieves his or her victory conditions-0

Team Play in the Works
An official team tournament format called Companies of Middle-earth is in the works. The premier of Companies of Middle-earth is at Origins '96 in Columbus, OH (July 4-7). Players compete as individual representatives from a company (the team) in a Swiss System format. Between rounds, the dimension of team decision making and role playing is added.
