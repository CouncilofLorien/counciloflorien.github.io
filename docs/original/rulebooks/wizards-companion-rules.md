# MIDDLE-EARTH<br>THE WIZARDS COMPANION

# • PART V •<br>ERRATA AND CLARIFICATIONS

The following list details card errata and clarifications. This list is official. If a card lists an errata, it means the text on the card is wrong or incomplete. If a card lists a clarification, it means that the text on the card could be ambiguous. All of these errata changes have been made on Unlimited Edition cards (i.e., blue bordered cards).

_Akhorahil_ (errata)—Replace "…gives -1 penalty to one character's body checks this turn." with "…modifies any one character's body by -1 for the rest of the turn."

_Align Palantir_ (clarification)—An aligned Palantir can be stored.

_Army of the Dead_ (errata)—May not be influenced by an opponent.

_Bane of the Ithil-stone_ (clarification)—This card cancels any action that _literally_ causes any player to search through or look at any portion of _any_ play deck or discard pile outside the normal sequence of play. E.g., this card cancels _Vilya_, which would otherwise allow Elrond's player to choose 5 cards from his discard pile and shuffle them into his play deck. This card does not cancel each player's card drawing option when a company reveals a new site, but it does cancel _Lucky Search_. This card does not affect an action which allows a player to bring cards from his sideboard into his discard pile or play deck. This card does not affect an action which otherwise only causes a player to reshuffle his play deck.

_Bill the Pony_ (errata)—The body of this ally is 10, not 6.

_Book of Mazarbul_ (errata)—Replace "…tap the bearer during your organization phase…" wit "…tap _Book of Mazarbul_ during your organization phase…"

_Call of Home_ (clarification)—Besides the one item automatically transferrable, all other non-follower cards target character controls are discarded.

_Call of the Sea_ (clarification)—Besides the one item automatically transferrable, all other non-follower cards target Elf controls are discarded.

_Corpse-candle_ (clarification)—If this attack is cancelled, the company does not have to make corruption checks.

_Corsairs of Umbar_ (errata)—May also be palyed at any site in Elven Shores, Eriadoran Coast, Andrast Coast, Bay of Belfalas, of Mounts of the Anduin.

_Cracks of Doom_ (errata)—Remove "Otherwise, discard _The One Ring_ and its bearer."

_Dodge_ (errata)—Replace "…his body check is modified by -1." with "…his body is modified by -1 for the resulting body check."

_Doors of Night_ (clarification)—This card only cancels resource environment effects already in play when this card is played. It does not cancel resource environment cards and effects played after this card is resolved. This card **cannot** be played after strikes from an attack have been assigned, if this card would cause the # of strikes from the attack to change. 

_Dragon's Desolation_ (clarification)—The second potion of this card lasts until the end of the turn or until a dragon is played with it. The second option must target a Ruins and Lairs site with the site path requirement. The site path to consider is the one given on the Ruins and Lairs site card. This card can be used to attack a company that does not move and is at a Ruins and Lairs site with the proper site path requirements.

_Drowning Seas_ (errata)—Remove "Cannot be duplicated."

_Dwarven Ring of Thelor's Tribe_ (errata)—The prowess/body modifications should read: "+2(4)/+1." Values in parenthesis and brackets apply to a Dwarf bearer.

_Dwarven Ring of Thrar's Tribe_ (errata)—The prowess/body modifications should read: "+2(4)/+1." Values in parenthesis and brackets apply to a Dwarf bearer.

_Ent-draughts_ (errata)—Remove "as a minor item" and replace with "**in addition to an ally or faction that have been successfully played at _Wellinghall_ this turn**."

_Escape_ (clarification)—An unwounded character must be used to satisfy the condition.

_The Evenstar_ (clarification)—The additional effect of this card if _Gates of Morning_ is in play (i.e., a Wilderness of a Border-land changes) is optional. Such a region of site type need not exist for this card to be declared.

_Eye of Sauron_ (clarification)—If _Doors of Night_ is in play, the _total_ prowess modification is +3 to each automatic-attack, not +3 in addition to the +1 listed at the start of this card.

_Foul Fumes_ (clarification)—For the additional effect if _Doors of Night_ is in play, the site path to consider is the one given on the site card.

_Gates of Morning_ (clarification)—This card only cancels hazard environment effects already in play when this card is played. It does not cancel hazard environment cards and effects played after this card is resolved. This card **cannot** be played after strikes from an attack have been assigned, if this card would cause the # of strikes from the attack to change. 

_Giant_ (clarification)—Add "_Giant_."

_Goldberry_ (clarification)—This ally can tap to cancel an effect declared earlier in the same chain of effects that would cause her company to return to its site of origin.

_The Great Goblin_ (errata)—"**_Unique._** _Orc_. One Strike…"

_Great-road_ (errata)—Change "Opponent draws twice…" to "Opponent may draw up to twice…"

_Great Ship_ (clarification)—A character can tap to cancel an attack. He can tap to cancel an ongoing hazard effect that targets his company or any entity associated with his company (item, character, site, etc.). He can tap to cancel an effect declared earlier in the same chain of effects.

_Halfling Strength_ (clarification)—This card can be played to heal all characters at the site if played to heal a Hobbit during the organization phase at a site where healing cards affect all characters at the site.

_Horses_ (clarification)—Add "Playable only at the end of the organization phase."

_Leaflock_ (clarification)—Add "_Awakened Plant_."

_Long Winter_ (clarification)—This ally can tap to cancel an attack. He can tap to cancel an ongoing hazard effect that targets his company or any entity associated with his company (item, character, site, etc.). He can tap to cancel an effect declared earlier in the same chain of effects.

_Lucky Search_ (clarification)—Playable at a tapped or untapped site. Does not exhaust play deck if its final card is revealed. Continue revealing cards if a unique item already in play is revealed.

_Lucky Search_ (errata)—Replace "Discard all revealed cards except the item." with "Reshuffle all revealed cards except the item back into play deck."

_Lure of Expedience_ (clarification)—A ring played in response to a test would also cause a corruption check.

_Lure of Nature_ (errata)—Replace "…at the end of each movement/hazard phase…" with "…after all other hazards have been played…"

_Lure of Nature_ (clarification)—These corruption checks may be targetted at any point during his company's movement/hazard phase.

_Mirror of Galadriel_ (clarification)—This card is playable is any of your characters is at Lorien.

_Morannon_ (errata)—"This card is used as a Dark-hold (![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)) site card in the region of Udun that is move to…"

_Morgul-horse_ (clarification)—The first option of this card must be declared in response to tapping a Nazgul permanent-event in the same chain of effects.

_Morgul-knife_ (clarification)—A wounded character receives the corruption from this card immediately following the Nazgul's attack.

_Morgul Night_ (clarification)—_Doors of Night_ is only required when this card is brought into play. This card and its effects would be unaffected if _Doors of Night_ were later discarded.

_Mouth of Sauron_ (errata)—Add "_Man_."

_Neeker-breekers_ \[promo card] (clarification)—A wizard does not face a strike from this hazard creature.

_Old Man Willow_ (clarification)—Add "_Awakened Plant_."

_Palantir of Amon Sul_ (clarification)—If bearer's company size goes below two during the movement/hazard phase when the company is moving to a new site, discard this card.

_Palantir of Osgiliath_ (clarification)—If bearer's company size goes below four during the movement/hazard phase when the company is moving to a new site, discard this card.

_The Pale Sword_ (clarification)—A wounded character receives the corruption from this card immediately following the Nazgul's attack.

_Praise to Elbereth_ (clarification)—When this card is played, you must declare which characters are targetting which Nazgul events. A cancelled Nazgul event&mdash;as a permanent-event or activated&mdash;is discarded and has no effect.

_The Precious_ (clarification)—The player playing this card chooses the character to make the corruption check.

_Pukel-men_ (clarification)—Add "_Pukel-creature_."

_Quiet Lands_ (clarification)—Replace "…is reduced by half its original number (rounded up)." with "…is reduced by half (round up)."

_Ren the Unclean_ (clarification)—All characters of all players must make a corruption check when this card becomes a short-event. For those characters whose turn it is **not**, no resource cards may be played to modify the corruption check, though untapped characters may tap to give +1 to another character's check in the same company.

_Ringlore_ (errata)—Add "**_Playable only during the site phase._**" Tap the sage and the site."

_River_ (errata)—Remove "Discard at the end of the turn."

_Roac the Raven_ (errata)—Remove "&mdash;no modifications to the influence check are required." Replace with "&mdash;treat this influence check as though it were made by a diplomat."

_Secret Entrance_ (clarification)—If it is shown that at the time this card was played (i.e., at the end of its company's organization phase) the company had a face down site card that was in a dark-domain, the effects of this card are cancelled though the sage remains tapped. A long-event, (e.g., _Morgul Night_) in play at the end of the organization phase would have to be considered when determining this.

_Seige_ (errata)—This card is playable on a border-hold. Change the border-land symbol in the first line to a border-hold symbol.

_Silent Watcher_ (errata)—Add "_Pukel-creature._" Gives 1 marshalling point, not 0.

_Tom Bombadil_ (clarification)—This ally can tap to cancel an attack. He can tap to cancel an ongoing hazard effect that targets his company or any entity associated with his company (item, character, site, etc.). He can tap to cancel an effect declared earlier in the same chain of effects.

_Traitor_ (errata)—This card is discarded when the character fails his corruption check.

_Twilight_ (errata)—This card may be played at any time during any player's turn.

_Twilight_ (clarification)—This card may target an environment card played earlier in the same chain of effects. This card may be played as a resource during opponent's turn, i.e., it would not count against the hazard limit.

_Use Palantir_ (clarification)—Change text to "**_Sage only._** Tap sage to enable him to use one Palantir he bears for the rest of the turn."

_Watcher in the Water_ (clarification)—Add "_Animal._"

_The White Tree_ (errata)—Discard the _Sapling of the White Tree._

_Wizard's Ring_ (errata)—Replace "Ignore any effect that would discard this item." with "Cannot be stored, stolen, or transferred."

_Wolves_ (errata)—Change "_Animals._" to "_Wolves._"

## RULES ANNOTATIONS

This section presents some annotations to various sections of the Starter and Standard Rules. They address situations that occur infrequently and often are subtle. Players should not get bogged down with committing this section to memory until they are comfortable with the regular rules and subtle issues on timing and so forth begin to arise.

### TARGETS

An action that is played out through one or more specific entities as stated on a card or in the rules is considered to "target" the entities. A targeted entity is said to be a "target" of the action. Possible targets include characters, sites, companies, regions, items, factions, corruption checks, and combat dice-rolls. A card that acts on a class of entities, however, does not target them (e.g., _Long Winter_). 

#### Annotation 1

_A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g., a corruption check._

#### Annotation 2

_A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared._

#### Annotation 3

_Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they generally affect an entire class of things._

#### Annotation 4

_An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-guard cards._

### ACTIONS AND ACTIVE AND PASSIVE CONDITIONS

There are two types of conditions for actions in _METW_: active and passive.

An _active_ condition must be in play or established when the action requiring it is declared. Typical active conditions are tapping a card and discarding a card. For example, _Magic Ring of Stealth_ can cancel a strike against its bearer if two particular active conditions are met: the bearer must be a scout and _Magic Ring of Stealth_ must tap. These are called active conditions because a player actively decides to invoke the action they satisfy. Active conditions serve as the price of an action. They are restrictions to the player invoking the action. In the case of _Magic Ring of Stealth_, the player cancelling the strike must have provided a scout and he must tap the ring, which renders the ring unable to be used again until his next turn.

#### Annotation 5

_If an action requires an entity to tap as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this
point; this is considered synonymous with the actions declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is cancelled._

#### Annotation 6

_If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the actions declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action._

#### Annotation 7

_If any other active condition for an action does not exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action were playing a card from your hand, it is discarded._

#### Annotation 8

_An action that requires a target is considered to have the active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared **and** when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects._

A _passive_ condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already in play. Typical passive conditions involve forcing corruption checks and forcing the effects of environmental long-events. These are called passive conditions because the actions they satisfy come into play only indirectly as a result of a decision made by a player.

#### Annotation 9

_If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action is cancelled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules._

{: .note }
> **Example:** _Foul Fumes_ is a long-event which states that if a company without a ranger has a shadow-land or dark-domain in its site path, it must return to its site of origin. Additionally, if _Doors of Night_ is in play, any site with a shadow-land or dark-domain in its site path becomes tapped.
> 
> Larry has two companies. When the first company reveals its new site, Larry's opponent, Mark, plays _Foul Fumes_. The first company is unaffected because it has all wildernesses in its site path. However, Larry's second company has no ranger and a shadow-land in its site path. Oops! The act of flipping over the second company's site card establishes the passive condition for _Foul Fumes_. Larry's second company returning to it site of origin becomes the first declared action in the chain of effects following.
> 
> Larry comes up with a plan to avoid this fate. One of his characters, a warrior, is bearing a _Beautiful Gold Ring_. A sage is in the company. In Larry's hand is a _Test of Lore_ and a _Magic Ring of Nature_. In response to the automatic action brought on by _Foul Fumes_, Larry plays _Test of Lore_ on the gold ring. No other actions are declared in this chain of effects. Larry rolls an 8 for the ring test. Subtracting one from
the roll as dictated by _Test of Lore_ results in a 7, which allows him to play _Magic Ring of Nature_. This gives the warrior, the bearer of the ring, ranger skill. A passive condition for _Foul Fumes_ is removed and thus the effect is cancelled!

#### Annotation 10

_If more than one action is required to be the first action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions have been declared._

### CARDS THAT "CANNOT BE DUPLICATED"

#### Annotation 11

_The requirement of cards that cannot be duplicated is **not** considered while a chain of effects is being declared and resolved. Once the chain is resolved, second and later resolved copies of any card in play that cannot be duplicated are discarded. Once the chain is resolved, second and later resolved effects of any card that cannot be duplicated are cancelled. Some cards cannot be duplicated in limited cases—generally on a specific target. Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each applies to a different target._

{: .note }
> **Example:** Teri plays _Doors of Night_ during Ying's movement/hazard phase. Teri then plays _Morgul Night_. Ying responds with _Twilight_ targeting _Doors of Night_; she sees that if _Doors of Night_ is discarded before _Morgul Night_ is resolved, _Morgul Night_ will also have to be discarded because its active condition for play would be removed (_Morgul Night_ is playable only if _Doors of Night_ is in play). Teri, however, responds with a second _Doors of Night_. This will preserve her _Morgul Night_. Resolving from first to last, Teri's second _Doors of Night_ comes into play. Even though _Doors of Night_ cannot be duplicated, the card may be declared even if another is in play. _Twilight_ is resolved next, so the first _Doors of Night_ is discarded. Finally, _Morgul Night_ is played successfully. If Ying had not played _Twilight_, Teri's second _Doors of Night_ would be discarded at the end of the chain of effects.[^discard] (Of course: Teri would not have played her second _Doors of Night_, if Ying had not played _Twilight_.)

### THE ATTACK

#### Annotation 12

_An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded when the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final strike, and the associated body check are resolved._

#### Annotation 13

_An attack may not be cancelled once its strikes have been assigned. A strike may not be cancelled once the dice-roll for the strike has been made._

#### Annotation 14

_A cancelled attack has no effect on its target company, except that the company is considered in its history to have faced the attack._

#### Annotation 15

_An attack must be the first declared action in a chain of effects, i.e., a creature card may not be played in response to another card in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception._

#### Annotation 16

_When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is considered in his history to have been wounded and must face any special actions the wounding strike presented him._

{: .note }
> **Example:** _The Pale Sword_ gives 6 corruption points to one character wounded by a Nazgul's strike that was enhanced by _The Pale Sword_. This corruption is to be assigned after the Nazgul's attack is resolved. If, in the meantime, another character in the wounded character's company tapped and used _Healing Herbs_ to make his companion unwounded, the attacking player could nevertheless assign _The Pale Sword_ as a corruption card to the character the Nazgul wounded.

### THE STRIKE SEQUENCE

The strike sequence is a period of time that begins when a player announces one of his characters will resolve a strike and ends after the strike dice-roll (or strike cancellation) and any body checks resulting from that strike.

#### Annotation 17

_The only actions that may be declared during a strike sequence are those outlined below._

#### Annotation 18

_When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike against a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by either player until the strike dice-roll are those outlined in the section on sequencing strikes ([page 24](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#the-strike-sequence)). An action that has the condition that a target character tap, but which otherwise has an effect not outlined in this section, may not be declared at this point. This is true even if the recipient of the strike would be the target character tapping and thus receive -1 to his prowess._

#### Annotation 19

_Following each successful strike or failed strike, a body check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However, if the strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by "William" may be required to discard his items), these special actions are resolved before the body check. The body check is the first declared action in a nested chain of effects that immediately follows the strike dice-roll and special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions may be declared in response to a body check in the same chain of effects, but these are limited to those actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. E.g., Tookish Blood could **not** be declared in response to the body check caused by Giant Spiders wounding a Hobbit. No action may be declared in response to a special action resulting from a strike unless the special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a special action is generally considered synonymous with the strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be declared in response to it if the action directly affects the dice-roll._

{: .note }
> **Example:** _Indur Dawndeath_, when in play as a permanent event, can tap and cause a wounded character to discard an item of his choice. Activating _Indur Dawndeath_ in this way may not be declared immediately following a successful strike. He must wait for a wounded character to make a body check before forcing him to discard an item. If the character wounded by the strike failed his body check, he could transfer all his items to unwounded characters in his company and _Indur_ could not touch them.

#### Annotation 20

_If more than one special action is to follow a strike, the defending player decides the order they are resolved._

#### Annotation 21

_A successful strike against a character is synonymous with that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the playing surface is not a separate action from the successful strike._

#### Annotation 22

_When a character fails a body check, his items may be immediately reassigned to unwounded characters in his company. Reassigning of the eliminated character's items is considered to be synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are then discarded._

### CORRUPTION CHECKS

#### Annotation 23

_When a character fails a corruption check, the standard effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or eliminated and his items being discarded) are implemented immediately and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g., The Precious), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., Traitor, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive condition of a failed corruption check, take effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check._

### GENERAL PLAY

#### Annotation 24

_If a card specifies that more than one action occurs when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed._

{: .note }
> **Example:** _Lucky Search_ taps a target scout when it is declared. When it is resolved, the following actions occur in the order listed (assuming the scout is still in play and tapped):
>  - turn over cards one at a time until you reach the end of your play deck or until a non-special item is revealed;
>  - the scout takes control of the non-special item revealed;
>  - the scout faces a single-strike attack with prowess equal to 3 plus the number of cards revealed (cannot be cancelled);
>  - reshuffle all revealed cards except the non-special item. (See p. 47)
>  
>  There is no way _Healing Herbs_ could be used to untap the scout before he faces the single-strike attack. You may not declare an action to occur within the sequence of actions stated on a card. If you declare _Healing Herbs_ after _Lucky Search_ in the same chain of effects, it would resolve before _Lucky Search_ resolves and untap the scout. This would cancel _Lucky Search_, because an action is cancelled if a target character, tapped when the action is declared, becomes untapped before the action is resolved. You could, of course, declare _Healing Herbs_ after the _Lucky Search_ chain of effects resolves and untap the scout, i.e., in its own chain of effects, but after the scout faces the attack. You could play _Risky Blow_ on the scout, if he were also a warrior, after playing _Lucky Search_ in the same chain of effects, because an action can target a dice-rolling action declared earlier in the same chain of effects.

#### Annotation 25

_A company is considered to be at the site given by their site card at all times except from the moment their new site card is revealed during their movement/hazard phase until their old site card is discarded during the same movement/hazard phase. During this period a company is considered to be en route between sites._

#### Annotation 26

_If at the start of a movement/hazard phase there are multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order they are applied, the player who is currently not taking his turn decides the order in which they are to be applied. Once this interpretation is established, all further actions are applied in the order they are resolved for the rest of the turn._

_Once the effects of an environment card have been applied to change a site type or a region type in a site path during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again during the current turn. If several environment cards are in effect at the beginning of a movement/hazard phase, the non-phasing player chooses the order in wh ich the effects of those cards are applied. This choice is made after the moving player has revealed the first movement declaration where the order of application would be a consideration._

{: .note }
> **Example:** At the start of Meredith's movement/hazard phase, _Morgul Night_ and _Fell Winter_, both long-events, are in play, because Meredith played them during Quinton's movement/hazard phase. _Morgul Night_ changes wildernesses to shadow-lands and shadow-lands to dark-domains; _Fell Winter_ changes free-domains to border-lands and border-lands to wildernesses. Meredith reveals the new site of one of her companies: Edhellond, which her company is moving to from Lorien. Quinton now decides the order the two long events are to be applied to the site path ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/free-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/free-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg). Since _Fell Winter_ does not affect wildernesses, _Morgul Night_ changes these to shadow-lands. The order the two environment cards are applied does not affect this outcome. Since Morgul Night does not affect free-domains, _Fell Winter_ changes these to borderlands. The order of the cards' application is important to determine the ultimate destiny of the border-lands printed on the site path. If _Morgul Night_ is applied first, then _Fell Winter_, the border-lands end up as wildernesses (_Morgul Night_ could not be reapplied to then change these new wildernesses to shadow-lands). If _Fell Winter_ is applied first, they end up as shadow-lands. Since Quinton is holding several double wilderness creatures in his hand, he chooses to apply _Morgul Night_ first, and then _Fell Winter_. For the remainder of the turn _Morgul Night_ must be applied first and then _Fell Winter_.
> 
> If Meredith plays _Moon_ at a later point during her turn, the order of application for the three cards is _Morgul Night_, _Fell Winter_, and then _Moon_.

#### Annotation 27

_If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for his choice of effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discarded—he may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect of the card._

{: .note }
> **Example:** Meredith plays a two-strike Troll-attack against one of Quinton's companies. Before declaring which untapped characters will receive the strikes, Quinton plays _Gates of Morning_. Then, Quinton plays _Dark Quarrels_ and chooses its second alternative effect, i.e., he would like to reduce the number of strikes of the Troll-attack by half to one. This alternative effect requires _Gates of Morning_ to be in play. Quinton believes his character _Boromir II_ can easily defeat one Troll-strike, but no other character would have good odds against the second strike. Naturally, Quinton is thinking about the marshalling points for defeating all strikes of this attack, so he does not want to cancel the attack. In response to _Dark Quarrels_, Meredith plays _Doors of Night_ which discards _Gates of Morning_. Quinton does not respond, and the two cards are resolved. First, _Doors of Night_ takes effect and _Gates of Morning_ is discarded. Then, _Dark Quarrels_ is resolved, but the active condition for Quinton's choice of effects no longer exists, so his card has no effect and he must choose to assign both strikes of the Troll-attack. Quinton does not have the option of now choosing the other alternative effect of _Dark Quarrels_, i.e., cancelling a Troll-attack.
> 
> **Example:** The _Witch-king of Angmar_ in play as a pennanent-event can tap during its opponent's movement/hazard phase and become a long-event changing all shadow-holds to dark-holds. During Claude's movement/hazard phase, Helmut has played _The Witch-king_ as a permanent-event. Claude plays _Gates of Morning_ and reveals a site for one of her companies that is a shadow-hold. For the purposes of playing hazards, Helmut wants this shadow-hold to change to a dark-hold; for the purposes of avoiding hazards, Claude wants the shadow-hold to change to a ruins & lairs. She plays _Quiet Lands_ which, among other alternatives, changes one shadow-hold (thus, a target site) to a ruins & lairs. Helmut taps _The Witch-king_ response to make the change he wants. Resolving the actions from last declared to first, _The Witch-king of Angmar_ goes off changing the shadow-hold to a dark-hold. _The Witch-king_ removed the target (and thus the active condition) for Claude's action! Unfortunately for her, _Quiet Lands_ fizzles for no effeet. She must discard it.

### NOTES ON SPECIFIC CARDS AND CARD COMBINATIONS

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Several types of cards are referred to by the key word included in the first few words of a card's text. For example, the text of a "spell" card starts with _spell_' the text of a "Nazgul" card starts with _Unique. Nazgul_; the text of a "Palantir" starts with _Unique. Palantir_.

#### Bringing Rings into Play

One of the types of items that your characters can bring into play are rings. There are five types of rings: gold rings, lesser rings, magic rings, Dwarven rings, and _The One Ring_.

**Gold Rings** — After your company faces the automatic-attack at such a site which specifies that a gold ring can be played, you just tap a character and the site to play a gold ring from your hand.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A gold ring is a ring with unknown properies—it might be a lesser ring, a magic ring, a Dwarven ring, or even _The One Ring_. You will not know until you "test" it. There are 3 kinds of gold rings: _Beautiful Gold Rings_, _Fair Gold Rings_, and _Precious Gold Rings_. Each has a different probability of being a specific type of special ring.

**Testing a Ring** — Once you have a gold ring, you can "test" it to determine what kind of special ring it is. When you test a gold ring, you make a roll and add any appliciable modification (due to the test card use and other cards). The gold ring card will indicate what special rings may be played based on the modified roll.

If the roll indicates a special ring that you have in your hand, you may replace the gold ring with that ring and discard the gold ring. Otherwise, you just discard the gold ring (i.e., it was not special). If the roll indicates more than one special ring in your hand, you choose which to play.

There are four ways to test a gold ring:

 - If you have a sage character in the same company as the gold ring, you can play a _Test of Form_ card or a _Test of Lore_ card (modify the roll by -1)
 - If you have your Wizard in the same company as the gold ring, you can play a _Wizard's Test_ card (you get to make two rolls and choose the one to use).
 - If you have a sage character in the same company as the gold ring and the company is at a site where "Information" is playable, you can play a _Ringlore_ card (you do not have to roll, you can just play any ring except _The One Ring_).
 - If _Gandalf_ is in the same company as the gold ring, he can tap to test it.

#### Destroying The One Ring

_The One Ring_ can be destroyed if its bearer has _Mount Doom_ as his company's current site and one of the following occurs:

 - The _Cracks of Doom_ card is played and the bearer passes the corruption check called for by the card.
 - _Gollum_ is in a company at _Mount Doom_ and the _Gollum's Fate_ card is played.

#### Environment Cards

There is a special class of cards called "environment" cards—the text for each such card starts with the word: _Environment_. These cards can change the physical environment in which your characters and companies move and take actions. For example, they can affect movement, region types, site types, an attack's number of strikes, and the prowess of characters and creatures.

_Resource environment_ cards represent influencing the physical nature of Middle-earth towards "good." _Hazard environment_ cards represent influencing the physical nature of Middle-earth towards "evil."

During play, the influence of good and evil on the environment shifts back and forth. These shifts are primarily focused through the play of _Doors of Night_ (a hazard), _Gates of Morning_ (a resource), and _Twilight_ (special).

When a _Doors of Night_ is played, all resource environment cards are discarded (i.e., the influence of good wanes) and all hazard environment cards become more powerful. Middle-earth is more dangerous for your characters.

When a _Gates of Morning_ is played, all hazard environment cards are discarded (i.e., the influence of evil wanes) and all resource environment cards become more powerful. Middle-earth is safer for your characters.

_Twilight_ causes one environment card to be discarded. Since it is often used to cancel a _Doors of Night_ or a _Gates of Morning_, _Twilight_ represents a shift towards the natural balance between good and evil. _Twilight_ can be played at anytime, either as a resource or as a hazard (it does not count against the hazard limit).

#### Using a Palantir

A character that controls (i.e., bears) a Palantir can _use_ its abilities if one of the following occurs:

 - The Palantir is "aligned" (i.e., it has an _Align Palantir_ card with it). An aligned Palantir may be transferred, but it becomes unaligned if moved.
 - The bearer is a sage, he taps, and he plays a _Use Palantir_ card.
 - The bearer is Saruman and he taps.

#### Playing Nazgul

When you play a Nazgul, you must decide whether it is being played as a creature or as a permanent-event. If played as a creature, it is handled like any other creature.

If played as a permanent-event, it remains in play until it is tapped to use its special ability. Tapping a Nazgul permanent-event counts as playing a hazard for all purposes (i.e., hazard limit, targeting restrictions, etc.).

[^discard]: The example states "If Ying had not played _Twilight_, Teri's second _Doors of Night_ would be discarded at the end of the chain of effects." However, if Ying had not played _Twilight_ then Teri could not have played the second _Doors of Night_ at all as this would be a violation of the rules on playing cards. Namely, a card cannot be discarded for no effect.
