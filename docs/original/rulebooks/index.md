# ORIGINAL RULEBOOKS

Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) published the rules for playing the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_) across various set and expansion rulebooks. A rulesbook or rules insert was published along with each set and expansion of _MECCG_. Additional rules and annotations to the rules were published in the _Companion_ books. 

ICE never published a complete and final ruleset as they were developing a second edition of _MECCG_ instead, called "Lord of the Rings Expandable Card Game." LoRE was never released as ICE lost their license to produce Middle-earth games.
