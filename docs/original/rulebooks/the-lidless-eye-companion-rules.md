# MIDDLE-EARTH<br>THE LIDLESS EYE COMPANION

## RULES ANNOTATIONS

This section presents some annotations to various sections of the Starter and Standard Rules. They address situations that occur infrequently and often are subtle. Players should not get bogged down with committing this section to memory until they are comfortable with the regular rules and subtle issues on timing and so forth begin to arise.

### TARGETS

An action that is played out through one or more specific entities as stated on a card or in the rules is considered to "target" the entities. A targeted entity is said to be a "target" of the action. Possible targets include characters, sites, companies, regions, items, factions, corruption checks, and combat dice-rolls. A card that acts on a class of entities, however, does not target them (e.g., _Foul Fumes_). 

#### Annotation 1

_A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g., a corruption check._

#### Annotation 2

_A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared._

#### Annotation 3

_Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they generally affect an entire class of things._

#### Annotation 4

_An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-guard cards._

### ACTIONS AND ACTIVE AND PASSIVE CONDITIONS

There are two types of conditions for actions in _MECCG:_ active and passive.

An active condition must be in play or established when the action requiring it is declared. Typical active conditions are tapping a card and discarding a card. For example, _Magic Ring of Guile_ can cancel a strike against its bearer if two particular active conditions are met: the bearer must be a scout and _Magic Ring of Guile_ must tap. These are called active conditions because a player actively decides to invoke the action they satisfy. Active conditions serve as the price of an action. They are restrictions to the player invoking the action. In the case of _Magic Ring of Guile_, the player cancelling the strike must have provided a scout and he must tap the ring, which renders the ring unable to be used again until his next turn.

#### Annotation 5

_If an action requires an entity to tap as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this
point; this is considered synonymous with the actions declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is cancelled._

#### Annotation 6

_If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the actions declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action._

#### Annotation 7

_If any other active condition for an action does not exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action were playing a card from your hand, it is discarded._

#### Annotation 8

_An action that requires a target is considered to have the active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared **and** when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects._

A _passive_ condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already in play. Typical passive conditions involve forcing corruption checks and forcing the effects of environmental long-events. These are called passive conditions because the actions they satisfy come into play only indirectly as a result of a decision made by a player.

#### Annotation 9

_If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action is cancelled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules._

{: .note }
> _E.g.,_ Long Winter _is a long-event which states that if a company without a ranger has two Wilderness in its site path, it must return to its site of origin. Additionally, if_ Doors of Night _is in play, any site with a two Wilderness in its site path becomes tapped._
> 
> _Larry has two companies. When the first company reveals its new site, Larry's opponent, Mark, plays_ Long Winter. _The first company is unaffected because it has all Shadow-lands and Dark-domains in its site path. However, Larry's second company has no ranger and two Wilderness in its site path. Oops! The act of flipping over the second company's site card establishes the passive condition for_ Long Winter. _Larry's second company returning to it site of origin becomes the first declared action in the chain of effects following._
> 
> _Larry comes up with a plan to avoid this fate. One of his characters, a warrior, is bearing a_ The Least of Gold Rings. _A Sage is in the company. In Larry's hand is a_ Test of Fire _and a_ Magic Ring of Savagery. _In response to the automatic action brought on by_ Long Winter, _Larry plays_ Test of Fire _on the gold ring. No other actions are declared in this chain of effects. Larry rolls a 7 for the ring test, which allows him to play_ Magic Ring of Savagery. _This gives the warrior, the bearer of the ring, ranger skill. A passive condition for_ Long Winter _is removed and thus the effect is cancelled!_

#### Annotation 9a

_If a card is required to be discarded by some passive condition, the card is discarded immediately when the condition resolves, not in the following chain of effects._

#### Annotation 10

_If more than one action is required to be the first action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions have been declared._

### CARDS THAT "CANNOT BE DUPLICATED"

#### Annotation 11

_Some cards cannot be duplicated in limited casesâ€”generally on a specific target. Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated can only be played when a copy is already in play if the copy in play is currently being targetted by an effect that will discard it._

{: .note }
> _E.g., Teri plays_ Doors of Night _during Ying's movement/hazard phase. Teri then plays_ Darkness Under Tree. _Ying responds with_ Twilight _targeting_ Doors of Night. _She sees that if_ Doors of Night _is discarded before_ Darkness Under Tree _is resolved,_ Darkness Under Tree _will also have to be discarded because its active condition for play would be removed (_ Darkness Under Tree _is playable only if_ Doors of Night _is in play). Teri, however, responds with a second_ Doors of Night. _This will preserve her_ Darkness Under Tree. _Resolving from first to last, Teri's second_ Doors of Night _comes into play. Even though_ Doors of Night _cannot be duplicated, the card may be declared because the first_ Doors of Night _is targeted for removal._ Twilight _is resolved next, so the first_ Doors of Night _is discarded. Finally,_ Darkness Under Tree _is successfully resolved, tapping one of Ying's characters. 

### THE ATTACK

#### Annotation 12

_An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded when the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final strike, and the associated body check are resolved._

#### Annotation 13

_An attack may not be cancelled once its strikes have been assigned. A strike may not be cancelled once the dice-roll for the strike has been made._

#### Annotation 14

_A cancelled attack has no effect on its target company, except that the company is considered in its history to have faced the attack._

#### Annotation 15

_An attack must be the first declared action in a chain of effects, i.e., a creature card may not be played in response to another card in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception._

#### Annotation 16

_When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is considered in his history to have been wounded and must face any special actions the wounding strike presented him._

### THE STRIKE SEQUENCE

The strike sequence is a period of time that begins when a player announces one of his characters will resolve a strike and ends after the strike dice-roll (or strike cancellation) and any body checks resulting from that strike.

#### Annotation 17

_The only actions that may be declared during a strike sequence are those outlined below._

#### Annotation 18

_When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike against a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by either player until the strike dice-roll are those outlined in the section on The Strike Sequence \[page 30]. An action that has the condition that a target character tap, but which otherwise has an effect not outlined in this section, may not be declared at this point. This is true even if the recipient of the strike would be the target character tapping and thus receive -1 to his prowess._

#### Annotation 19

_Following each successful strike or failed strike, a body check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However, if the strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by Brigands may be required to discard an item), these special actions are resolved before the body check. The body check is the first declared action in a nested chain of effects that immediately follows the strike dice-roll and special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions may be declared in response to a body check in the same chain of effects, but these are limited to those actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. No action may be declared in response to a special action resulting from a strike unless the special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a special action is generally considered synonymous with the strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be declared in response to it if the action directly affects the dice-roll._

{: .note }
> _E.g.,_ Indur Dawndeath _, a hazards from_ Middle-earth: The Wizards, _when in play as a permanent event, can tap and cause a wounded character to discard an item of his choice. Activating_ Indur Dawndeath _in this way may not be declared immediately following a successful strike. He must wait for a wounded character to make a body check before forcing him to discard an item. If the character wounded by the strike failed his body check, he could transfer all his items to unwounded characters in his company and_ Indur _could not touch them.

#### Annotation 20

_If more than one special action is to follow a strike, the defending player decides the order they are resolved._

#### Annotation 21

_A successful strike against a character is synonymous with that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the playing surface is **not** a separate action from the successful strike._

#### Annotation 22

_When a character fails a body check, his items may be immediately reassigned to unwounded characters in his company. Reassigning of the eliminated character's items is considered to be synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are then discarded._

### CORRUPTION CHECKS

#### Annotation 23

_When a character fails a corruption check, the standard effects of this i.e., the character being eliminated and his items being discarded, are implemented immediately and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g., The Roving Eye), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., Traitor from Middle-earth: The Wizards, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive condition of a failed corruption check, take effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check._

### GENERAL PLAY

#### Annotation 24

_If a card specifies that more than one action occurs when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed. As an exception, if one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the strike sequence (see Annotation 18)._

#### Annotation 25

_A company is considered to be at the site given by their site card at all times except from the moment their new site card is revealed during their Movement/Hazard phase until their old site card is discarded during the same Movement/Hazard phase. During this period a company is considered to be en route between sites._

#### Annotation 25a

_A company's movement/hazard phase is concluded when a moving company removes its site of origin and both players agree to reconcile (discard down to/draw up to) their hand sizes. No resources (and obviously no hazards) can be playedâ€”and no resource effects can be activatedâ€”until the site phase or until both players have draw cards for the movement of a following company._

#### Annotation 25b

_Players drawing cards when a new site is revealed is synonymous with the resolution of the new site being revealed. It happens immediately, not in the following chain of effects._

#### Annotation 26

_If at the start of a movement/hazard phase there are multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order they are interpreted, the player whose turn it is not decides the order they are to be interpreted. Once this interpretation is established, all further actions are interpreted in the order they are resolved for the rest of the turn._


#### Annotation 27

_If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for his choice of effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discardedâ€”he may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect of the card._
