# MIDDLE-EARTH<br>THE LIDLESS EYE COMPANION

{: .text-center }
## • PART VI •<br>ERRATA AND CLARIFICATIONS

This section lists errata and clarifications to the cards and rulesbook of _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_. If a card or rule lists an errata, it means the text of the card is wrong or incomplete. If a card or rule lists a clarification, it means the text could be ambiguous. All of these are official and are included in the _MECCG_ Collected Rulings File (MECCG CRF) which can be found on ICE's WEB page at http://www.ironcrown.com. The MECCG CRF is maintained by Craig "Ichabod" O'Brien at ichabod@cstone.net.

Agent Minions (from _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_) (clarification)—While in play, agents played as hazards may not become minion characters, and agents played as minion characters may not become hazards.<br>
&emsp; An agent minion (played as a character) may only be played at his home site (except with _We Have Come to Kill_).<br>
&emsp;You may not start with agent minions in your starting company. <br>
&emsp; When constructing a Ringwraith deck, agent minions are always considered characters.

_Black Rider_ (clarification)—This card does not allow Ringwraiths to use region movement.

Body Check (clarification)—Effects that modify a character's body also modify the number an Orc or Troll would be discarded on. A maximum to body applies equally to this card number.<br>
&emsp; If an Orc or Troll is discarded by the results of a body check, all cards played on the character are also discarded.<br>
&emsp; You check for an Orc or Troll being discarded before checking for the character's death.

Character Draft (errata)—Ringwraith players may start with 6 characters in the character draft, not just 5.

Company Limitations (clarification)—If a company must return to its site of origin because a combined company would violate company composition rules, the hazard player chooses which company returns to its site of origin.<br>
&emsp; Two companies may not start at the same site and move to the same new site.

Company vs. Company Combat (clarification)—The defender may take actions that affect the attack or any of the strikes. The attacker may only take actions taht affect individual strikes. <br>
&emsp; _True Fana_ and _Sacrfice of Form_ (from _Middle-earth: The Wizards_) cannot be used in company vs. company combat.

Darkhaven (clarification)—Whenever something affecting a hero refers to a Darkhaven, interpret it as referring to a Haven instead.

Direct Influence (clarification)—Restricted direct influence is limited in its use, usually to characters or factions of specific races. Unrestricted direct influence has no restrictions on its use. When a character suffers a minus to direct influence, it must come from unrestricted direct influence first. If there is no unrestricted influence and there are multiple instances of restricted direct influence, the character's player may choose which restricted direct influence the minus is applied to.

_Dwar Unleashed_ (clarification)—Dwar the Ringwraith must already be in a mode (Fell Rider, Black Rider, or Heralded Lord) to use this card.

_Deeper Shadow_ (errata)—This is a short-event, not a long-event.

Detainment Attacks (clarification)—Automatic-attacks are not detainment attacks unless specifically stated on the site card.

_Fell Rider_ (clarification)—This card does not allow Ringwraiths to use region movement.

Haven (clarification)—Whenever something affecting a minion refers to a Haven, interpret it as referring to a Darkhaven instead.

_Heralded Lord_ (clarification)—This card does not allow Ringwraiths to use region movement.

_Ice-orcs_ (errata)—Change the Shadow-hold symbol to a Ruins & Lairs symbol.

Keyed (clarification)—Only attacks from hazard creatures are considered "keyed."

_The Lidless Eye_ (clarification)—Playing this card discards its players _Bade to Rule_ and prevents him from subsequently playing _Bade to Rule_.

Marshalling Points (errata)—Under standard rules, no more than half of your marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling point. Do not round up. 

MELE vs. METW (clarification)—Hero items may not be used as passive conditions[^passiveconditions] for minion resources, and minion items may not be used as passive conditions for hero resources.<br>
&emsp; If you are playing in a Council of Lorien constructed deck tournament, you may play with three Ringwraiths. You may play with two of one Ringwraith and one of another, or with three of one Ringwraith. You may not play with one each of three different Ringwraiths. You must have a minimum of 30 resources and 30 hazards with the 12 creature minimum.<br>
&emsp; Hero characters may not cancel automatic-attacks at their homesite, regardless of their opponent.<br>
&emsp; You may not have both the minion and hero version of a unique item in your deck.

Minion characters (clarification)—Are not affected by cards that target agents.

Ringwraiths (clarification)—Ringwraiths may not use region movement. Ringwraiths may only move to a non-Darkhaven site if they are in a mode (Fell Rider, Black Rider, or Heralded Lord). <br>
&emsp; In general, effects that affect Nazgul do not affect Ringwraiths. The exception is that characters with combat bonuses against Nazgul also get these bonuses against Ringwraiths.<br>
&emsp; Ringwraiths may not move from one Darkhaven to another with non-Ringwraith characters. Neither may a Ringwraith company and a non-Ringwraith company move from the same Darkhaven to the same Darkhaven on the same turn. 

Ringwraith Followers (clarification)—Ringwraith followers may use magic as printed on their card.

_Ruse_ (clarification)—If _Ruse_ is played by a scout who is the only characters in the company, the attack has no effect, and, if there is a creature card, it is discarded. It is considered faced, but not cancelled. 

_Spider of the Morlat_ (from _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_) (clarification)—Spider attacks from _Spider of the Morlat_ played as a permanent-event are considered detainment vs. minion companies.

_Sudden Call_ (clarification)—You may not shuffle _Sudden Call_ into your deck while you are drawing cards. Drawing cards is an indivisible action.

Trophies (clarification)—Creatures whose marshalling points are listed with an * give marshalling points when used as trophies.<br>
&emsp; Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies. 

_Uvatha the Ringwraith_ (clarification)—Uvatha's special ability does not get around the one character per turn limitation.
