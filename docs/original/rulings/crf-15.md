# Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game

Collected Clarifications to the Rules
{: .text-center .text-beta}

## Introduction

This is version 15 of the collected clarifications to the rules for the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_, up to May 29, 1999; including up to digest 578 of the mailing list. Some of these clarifications are considered errata to the rules or cards, and are noted as such. The [Turn Sequence](#turn-sequence-rulings) and [Rulings by Term](#rulings-by-term) sections are specifically considered clarifications to the rules, and are therefore overridden by card text that specifically does so. A [complete list of errata](#complete-errata-listing) is included. There will be periodic updates to this file, and items marked with a "@" are new or changed since the last version.

New rulings that clarify ambiguous situtations take effect immediately. Reversals of old rulings, changes to the rules, and new rulings not covering ambiguous situations will not have an effect on tournament play until two to four weeks after they are made. Every other Monday, starting November 3, 1997, will be a [Rulings Monday](#rulings-monday). On a Rulings Monday, delayed rulings that have been made will be announced on the internet, and rulings that were announced on the previous Rulings Monday will take effect.

The main thing to remember, when making rulings based on the rules and the cards, is that if it isn't there, then it isn't there. If a card says a site counts as a Haven for purposes of healing, that does not mean the site counts as a Haven for any other purposes. If a card says it can be played as a resource, that does not mean it counts as a resource at any time except when it is being played. Remember: If it isn't there, it isn't there.

Tournament rules for _MECCG_ differ slightly from the rules for casual play. Rulings marked with a "#" differ from those in tournament play. When playing in a tournament, be sure to check the [Tournament Rulings](#tournament-rulings) section.

If you have any further questions concerning _MECCG_, you can either:

 - Write Iron Crown Enterprises at P.O. Box 1605, Charlottesville, VA, 22902.
 - Email the official rules representative, Van Norton, at: \<mailto: vnorton@mindspring.com>
 - Post the message to the Usenet news group rec.games.trading-cards.misc, with "\[MECCG]" in the subject line.

### Beginning of the Game

\# If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in
the starting company, then it does not
count against the 10 character limit.

\# You should either draw numbers for the whole game or
roll dice for the whole game.

 Your starting company can only contain 20 points of
unmodified mind.

 Non-character cards duplicated in the character draft may
not be placed into the play deck.

 Your staring hand is eight cards, regardless of what
characters you have at particular sites.

### Untap Phase

 Corruption checks triggered at the end of the untap phase
happen after everyone untaps.

### Organization Phase

#### Choosing a New Site

 Rules Erratum: When a company splits, any of the
resulting companies can move with
region movement. Region movement is not limited to one
company of a split.

 Any single site path cannot have more than one copy of a
particular region.

 Any company may declare as its new site a site already on
the table. That site will remain on
the table at least until the end of that company's
movement/hazard phase.

 Two companies may not start at the same site of origin
and move to the same new site.

 Effects that are played during the organization phase,
and depend on the site or site path of a
moving company, create an effect which is not declared
until the new site is revealed. If the
site or site path is not of the appropriate type when the
effect resolves, the resource has no
effect. If the company has multiple movement/hazard
phases on the same turn, the card
applies separately to each phase, having an effect only
if the correct conditions are met.

#### Followers

 A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence
against "Blue Mountain Dwarves" to
control characters with the home site Blue Mountain
Dwarf-hold. The bonus only applies to
the faction.

 Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only
once, not for each character.

#### Organizing Companies

 When a company splits up, its player chooses which
characters are the original company and
which characters are a new company, unless otherwise
directed by a card. All resource
permanent-events played on the original company stay with
the original company.

 Company composition changes that you choose to make,
including bringing a character into
play, must all be done at the same time during the
organization phase. During this time no
other actions may be taken.

 If a company splits, all but one of the split companies
must attempt to move to a different
site this turn. The company may not rejoin in the same
phase.

 You may transfer a character from one company at a site
to another, without creating a third
company.

 See also Rulings by Term, Company and Influence.
 
#### Playing Characters

 Rules Erratum: You may play a character if you do not
have enough influence to control
them. However, if there are any characters you do not
have the influence to control at the
end of your organization phase, the character you brought
into play this turn must be
returned to your hand.

 If you play a Ringwraith at a non-Darkahven site where
there is one of your non-Ringwraith
comapnies, one of the companies must move that turn. If
both companies are still there at
the end of the movement/hazard phase, discard the
non-Rinwraith company. \[Effective
11/17/97]()

#### Storing Items

 Minions who roll equal to or one less than their
accumulated corruption when storing an
item are only tapped.

 A minion who taps from a corruption check for
storing/transferring an item still successfully
stores/transfers that item.

### Long Event Phase

### Movement/Hazard Phase

#### General

 Annotation 25: A company is considered to be at the site
given by its site card at all times
except from the moment their new site card is revealed
during their movement/hazard phase
until their old site card is discarded during the same
movement/hazard phase. During this
period a company is considered to be en route between
sites and not at any site.

 Annotation 25a: A company's movement/hazard phase is
concluded when a moving
company removes its site of origin and both players agree
to reconcile (discard down
to/draw up to) their hand sizes. No resources (and
obviously no hazards) can be played, and
no resource effects can be activated, until the site
phase or until both players have drawn
cards for the movement of a following company.

 Annotation 25b: Players drawing cards when a new site is
revealed is synonymous with the
resolution of the new site being revealed. It happens
immediately, not in the following chain
of effects.

 Annotation 26: If at the start of a player's
movement/hazard phase, there are multiple
effects in play such that their net effect depends on the
order they are applied, the player
who is currently not taking his turn (i.e., the hazard
player) decides the order in which they
are to be applied. Once this interpretation is
established, all further actions are applied in the
order they are resolved for the rest of the turn.

 Once the effects of an environment card have been applied
to a target during a given
movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again
to that target during the current turn.

 When you draw cards for movement, you may continue
drawing cards until you either want
to stop, or have drawn the number of cards allowed for
the movement.

 Companies at the same non-Haven/non-Darkhaven site must
join at the end of all
movement/hazard phases, before the site phase starts.
Companies at the same
Haven/Darkhaven site may join at this time.

 If companies would join at the end of the movement/hazard
phase such that the company
composition rules are violated, one company of the hazard
player's choice must return to its
site of origin.

 If two companies join at a site, cards affecting one of
the companies now affect them both.

 Removing the site of origin and resetting to hand size
are simultaneous actions, and they are
the last actions in any movement/hazard phase. This means
a moving company is not at a
site until the site phase. [effective 11/17/97]()

 The same region (as in region card) may not occur twice
in a single site path.

 A non-moving company's current site is considered its new
site for card play.

### Movement

#### General
 If a company does not move, it still has a
movement/hazard phase. No cards are drawn
based on the company's movement, and the only hazards
that can be played on the company
are creatures that can be keyed to the company's site and
events.

 Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they
look that way on some maps.

 If a company moves twice in one turn, resources played
during the organization phase, like
Secret Passage, are reapplied to the company at the
beginning of each of their
movement/hazard phases, if the conditions of the card are
met.

 If both players have access to region movement, then
neither player may be stopped from
using region movement. Access includes region cards or an
appropriate map.

#### Playing Hazards

 Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard
them for an effect, and this does
not count against the hazard limit unless specified
otherwise on the card. \[effective 11/17/97]

 Hazards may only be played on a company whose
movement/hazard phase is being resolved,
or on the site they are moving to. Long-events and
permanent- events may effect more than
one company even though they are only played "on" one
company.

 If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a
region type, those region types do not
have to be consecutive in the site path.

 If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent
plays a resource before the
movement/hazard phase ends, you may then resume playing
hazards, assuming you have not
yet reached the hazard limit.

 If a company is moving from a surface site to an
Under-deeps site, hazards may not be
played keyed to the region of the surface site.

 Angmar Arises, In Darkness Bind Them, and Reaching Shadow
may not be used to play
creatures keyed to double shadow-lands.

 A creature "played at" a site is the same as being "keyed
to" the site.

 A creature "played at a site in" a region is the same as
being "keyed to" the site by name.
 For the purposes of interpreting hazards, no Darkhaven or
Haven has a site path except for
Geann a-Lisch.

 You check the hazard limit at declaration and resolution.
At declaration there must be less
hazards already declared than the hazard limit. At
resolution there must be no more hazards
declared than the hazard limit.

#### Returning to Site of Origin
 If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path
immediately disappears, and its
movement/hazard phase immediately ends.

 An effect that returns a company to its site of origin
may not be declared in the middle of an
attack.

 @ Rules Erratum: If a company returns to it's site of
origin, it may do nothing during it's site
phase. A company failing it's underdeeps movement roll is
not effected by this rule.

### Combat

#### General

 Side effects of losing a character are resolved
immediately after the character is lost, before
other characters resolve their strikes.

 All strikes of an attack must be assigned before any are
resolved.

 See also Rulings by Term, Ally and Body Check; and
Turn Sequence, Site Phase, Company
vs. Company Combat.

#### Attack

 Annotation 12: An attack is considered to be resolved and
concluded when the final strike,
all special actions resulting from the final strike, and
the associated body check are resolved.

 Annotation 13: An attack may not be canceled once its
strikes have been assigned. A strike
may not be canceled once the dice-roll for the strike has
been made.

 Annotation 14: A canceled attack has no effect on its
target company, except that the
company is considered in its history to have faced the
attack.

 Annotation 15: An attack must be the first declared
action in a chain of effects, i.e., a
creature card may not be played in response to another
card in the same chain of effects. 
Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception.

 In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an
attack, the character doing so must be in
the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site
type a hazard creature was keyed to
can be affected otherwise.

 Cards only modify attacks if they say they specifically
mention attacks.

 When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the
MPs, the creature goes to the
out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played the
attack. They may still be taken as a
trophy, but go to the appropriate out-of-play pile when
the trophy is discarded.

 Excess strikes applied as -1 modifiers do not have to
have their body defeated.

 If an attack states all characters in a company face a
strike, then effects which allow a
character to face more than one strike have no effect
against the attack. Similarly, effects
that change the attack's number of strikes have no
effect. As an exception, effects which
reduce the number of strikes to a specific number do
work.

 Any effect that would change the number of strikes for an
attack may not be played after
strikes are assigned. This includes cards that have other
additional effects, and cards that
only indirectly change the number of strikes.

 Attacks created by events are not keyed to anything
unless specifically stated as being keyed
to something on the card.

 There are three levels of cards which reassign strikes.
Alatar is the top level, and overrides
any other conflicting card which changes the assignment
of strikes. Cards which say they
"always" or "in all cases" change the assignment of
strikes are the next level, and override
any other conflicting effects except Alatar. Cards which
say they change the assignment of
strikes "regardless of ..." certain factors are the
third level, and are overridden by all other
effects from conflicting cards. If two effects on the
same level conflict, the resource
overrides the hazard.

 If an attack can not be cancelled, strikes from the
attack may still be cancelled.

 An attack is considered faced by a company if it
successfully resolves in its chain of effects.

 Attacks or strikes keyed by name to a region or site
cannot be cancelled by effects which
refer only to the type of the region or site.

#### The Strike Sequence

 Annotation 16: When a wounded character becomes
unwounded, he is considered in his
history to have been wounded and must face any special
actions the wounding strike
presented him.

 Annotation 17: The only actions that may be declared
during a strike sequence are those
outlined in Annotation 18.

 Annotation 18: When a defending player chooses to resolve
a strike against a particular
character, the only actions that may be taken by either
player until the strike dice-roll is
made are the following: playing hazard cards that affect
the strike, the attacker may decide
to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications due
to strikes in excess of the company's
size, a target untapped character may take a -3
modification so that he will not automatically
tap, and the defending character may play resource cards
that affect the strike. An action that
has the condition that a target character tap, but
which otherwise has an effect not outlined
here, may not be declared at this point. This is true
even if the recipient of the strike would
be the target character tapping and thus receive -1 to
his prowess.

 Annotation 19: Following each successful strike or failed
strike, a body check must be
rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However,
if the strike calls for any special
actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by
"William" may be required to discard his
items), these special actions are resolved before the
body check. The body check is the first
declared action in a nested chain of effects that
immediately follows the strike dice-roll and
special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions
may be declared in response to a body
check, in the same chain of effects, but these are
limited to those actions that directly affect
the body check dice-roll. E.g., Tookish Blood could
not be declared in response to the body
check caused by Giant Spiderswounding a Hobbit. No action
may be declared in response to a
special action resulting from a strike unless the
special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a
special action is generally considered synonymous with
the strike dice-roll. If the special
action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be
declared in response to it if the action
directly affects the dice-roll.

 Annotation 20: If more than one special action is to
follow a strike, the defending player
decides the order they are resolved.

 Annotation 21: A successful strike against a character is
synonymous with that character
being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the
playing surface is not a separate action
from the successful strike.

 Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general,
wounded characters are not
considered tapped.

 Non-item prowess bonuses are applied in the order the
player controlling the character
decides.

 If a character is facing two strikes, and the first
strike kills the character, the second strike is
considered successful.

 There is time between the strike sequences to take
actions that are otherwise legal.

### Site Phase

#### General

 Items, factions and allies must be played during the site
phase.

 There is no one resource card per site phase rule.
 
However, the tapping of the site usually
limits you to one card per site phase.

 The site taps upon successful play of the resource that
would tap it.

 A company may not play any resource during the site phase
until they have faced all
automatic-attacks, unless that resource directly affects
an automatic-attack. Removing an
automatic-attack does not directly affect it, although
cancelling does.

 You may only play a free minor item after playing an
ally, faction, or item that taps the site.

 See also Rulings by Term, Item.
 
 Play of an ally, item, faction, or resource card which
will normally tap the site must be after
the company resolves all automatic, agentm and on-guard
creature attacks.

#### Company vs. Company Combat

 The defender may take actions that affect the attack or
any of the strikes. The attacker may
only take actions that affect individual strikes.

 True Fana and Sacrifice of Form cannot be used in company
versus company combat.

 @ Rules Erratum: Hazards effects in play that affect
attacks have no effect on company vs.
company combat.

 Only the defender is considered to be facing an attack,
but all characters are considered to be
facing strikes.

 Tapped defending characters choose their strikes after
untapped attacking characters have
assigned their strikes.

 Minion and hero companies can attack each other. Hero
companies may not attack each
other. A Fallen Wizard covert company is considered a
hero company.

 See also Card Rulings, Swarm of Bats.
 
#### Automatic-attacks

 A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an
automatic-attack, and this counts as facing the
automatic-attack.

 Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the
normal automatic- attacks for the site.

Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in the order listed
and/or resolved.

 Company composition and overt/covert status is checked
before each automatic attack.

 Any character may tap to cancel one automatic-attack at
his home site.

 The only resources you may play against automatic-attacks
are ones that cancel the attack,
cancel a strike, or would be otherwise playable during
the strike sequence.

#### Influence Attempts

 @ It is not possible to influence anything away from a
Wizard or Ringwraith.

 You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.
 A successful influence attempt on an opponent's resource
does not tap the site.

 You may only make one influence attempt against your
opponent's resources during each
turn.

 When influencing factions across alignments, you roll
against the number on the card in
play, that you are trying to influence away.

 For a Fallen-wizard, the resource revealed must match the
alignment of the site at which the
attempt is taking place.

#### On-Guard Cards

 Rules Erratum: An on-guard card may only be revealed if
it could have also been played
during the movement/hazard phase. This means all targets
of the card must have existed
during the movement/hazard phase in order for the card to
be revealed.

 A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as
though it were both declared and
resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects during
which it was revealed.

 An on-guard card may be revealed when the company plays a
resource that potentially taps
the site. The card must affect the company or a character
in the company that site phase. Note that this clarification is looser than the rule printed on p.61 of the Unlimited Rules book.

 A successful ring test does not allow an on-guard card to
be revealed.

 You may reveal a card in response to an influence attempt
against a faction even if the
on-guard card only has an effect if the attempt is
successful. You may also reveal a card in
response to such an attempt that affects the actual
influence attempt.

 Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be
considered when determining the
validity of revealing an on-guard card. Potential effects
that have not been triggered cannot
be considered.

 A card cannot be revealed that:

- Returns a company to its site of origin.
- Taps a company's site.
- Potentially removes a character from a company, besides combat or corruption checks.
- Forces a company to do nothing during its site phase.
- Directly taps a character in the company.

 A card that potentially removes an ally from the company
can be revealed, so long as it otherwise is legal.

 The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's
hand.

 When an on-guard card is revealed, it immediately ceases
to be considered an on-guard card.

 Creatures may only be revealed on-guard if there is an
automatic-attack at the site.

 If two companies are at a Haven, on-guard cards played on
one company can only be
revealed against that company, and can only affect that
company (unless the hazard states it
affects all versions of the site).

 @ If the site an on-guard card is played on leaves play
before the site phase, the on-guard
cards are returned to their owner's hand.

 See also Rulings By Term, Burglary Attempts.
 
### End-of-Turn Phase
 End-of-turn effects are triggered by the ending of the
End-of-Turn phase. Once both players
are done with all actions in the End-of-Turn phase, all
End-of-Turn effects are declared and
resolved in the order chosen by the current player. No
further actions may be declared that
turn.

 Cards may be played during the End-of-Turn phase after
hand size has been reconciled.

 Replacing one site with another at the end of the turn
counts as movement, without a
movement/hazard phase.

### End-of-Game
 These rulings apply to any end game, whether it is the
Free Council, the Audience with
Sauron, or the Day of Reckoning.

 Characters may tap to aid corruption checks, if they are
in the same company.

 Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have
an effect.

 Only resources that directly affect corruption checks may
be played during the Free Council. This includes cards that reduce a character's corruption
point total or prevent a character
from being discarded.

 When determining if more than half of your marshalling
points come from one type of
marshalling point, ignore negative marshalling points. The easy way to do this is if one
category is more than half of your positive marshalling
points, reduce that category to equal
all of your other positive marshalling point categories
combined.

 To calculate marshalling points at the Free Council,
follow these steps:

 - Total up the marshalling points for each category. The modifications from My Precious, factions played on a leader, and eliminated characters apply now.
 - If your opponent has no points in a category double your points in that category. Doubling does not apply to the Miscellaneous or Kill categories.
 - If one of your categories accounts for more than half of your positive marshalling point total, reduce it so that it has the same number of points as the rest of your positive categories combined.
 - Subtract any points that are subtracted from your total, including points from unique resources your opponent has duplicated in his hand.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Under-deeps.

 Marshalling points that minions have at an Under-deeps
site do not count for calling the
Audience with Sauron, but do count at the Audience with
Sauron.

 You may only call the Free Council if you have met the
deck cycling and marshalling point
requirements, not if only your opponent has.

 You may not recieve kill MPs from a card you played.
 
 MPs from special and minor items count as item MPs.

### -= AAA =-

#### Actions
Tapping a resource can only be done at a time when you could otherwise play a resource event.

#### Active Conditions
An active condition must be in play or established when the action requiring it is declared. Active conditions serve as the price of an action. They are restrictions on the player invoking the action.

Annotation 5: If an action requires an entity to tap as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this point; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is canceled.

Annotation 6: If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action.

Annotation 7: If any other active condition for an action does not exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action was playing a card from your hand, it is discarded.

Annotation 8: An action that requires a target is considered to have the active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared and when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects.

Your opponent's resources may be the active conditions for your resources, but may not be the targets for your resources.

If an "alternative" or "additional" effect does not have any "playable ..." conditions, then the "playable on ..." conditions from the primary effect of the card apply. The following cards are exceptions to this rule: Gloom, Good Sense Revolts, Half an Eye Open, Heedless Revelry, Here is a Snake, In the Name of Mordor, Inner Cunning, Nobody's Friend, Withdrawn to Mordor, and Wolf-riders.

See also Rulings by Term, Target.

#### Agent

Rules Erratum: A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move from tapped status to utapped status).

Rules Erratum: An agent may tap to play creatures at a site if the company is moving to the site.

Rules Erratum: Agent attacks against minions are always detainment. [Effective 8/27/98]

Playing a card that makes an agent attack is considered the attack's declaration.

Agents are not creatures.

Rolls made by agents during combat are done simultaneously with rolls made by characters during combat, after step 4 of the strike sequence.

Only face-up agents are considered for uniqueness.

While in play agents played as hazards may not become minion characters, and agents played as minion characters may not become hazards.

An agent played as a character in a Ringwraith deck can only be played at his home site.

When constructing a Ringwraith deck, agents are always considered characters. The maximum of 36 mind of agents in your sideboard and play deck combined still applies.

To wound an agent you only need to defeat the prowess of one strike. To eliminate an agent you must defeat the prowess and body for all strikes.

Revealed agents may return to their home site, even if they are at one of their home sites.

Cards played on an agent remain face up when the agent turns face down.

Agents may not move to any version of a hero Haven, unless they have a special ability allowing them to.

Fallen-wizards use minion rules for agents, except where specified by the White Hand rules insert.

Only Elven agents can move to a site that is a Wizardhaven.

Agent attacks are not keyed to anything.

When an agent is revealed, only the site he is at will be affected by environment cards.

Agents do not get the -5 penalty for influencing across alignments.

If you are a Ringwraith, your agents may move as if Dagorlad and Udun are adjacent.

The rules on agent movement do not apply to revealed agents, since they refer to the first site card played, which is 
discarded when the agent is revealed the first time.

When you flip an agent face down, leave it's current site face up with the agent. That now counts as a legal first card "played" for when you reveal the agent again.

Agents in starting companies count against the 36 mind limit.

An agent may only attack once per site phase.

See also Rulings by Term, Card Effect Limitations.

#### Ahunt Manifestations

If one Ahunt is out and you move through two or more of the regions listed on it, then you face the attack once.

#### Ally

Allies may tap to cancel attacks from Slayers and Assassins.

Allies cannot be targeted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot be taken prisoner.

If an ally may not be attacked by certain attacks, he may still tap to give +1 prowess to characters facing such attacks.

Playing an ally is not an influence attempt.

If an ally's controller leaves play for any reason, that ally is discarded.

Allies can be healed as if they were characters. Otherwise, allies are only considered characters for the purposes of combat and playing skill cards.

Allies count as characters for the purposes of combat, including performing actions in combat that characters do (getting assigned strikes, tapping for +1 to prowess) and for the play of cards that directly affect the attack.

### -= BBB =-

#### Balrog

@ Erratum: Balrog players receive no MPs for hero items played at their darkhavens.

#### Burglary Attempts

After a successful burglary attempt, another character may tap to play a minor item.

The character who fails the burglary roll must face the automatic-attack as though he were a one-character company. He can receive no combat support other than what he himself can provide.

On-guard creatures are faced by the whole company after a Burglaring attempt, regardless of the success of the attempt.

#### Body Check

Annotation 22: When a character fails a body check, his items may be immediately reassigned to unwounded characters in his company, one item per character. Reassigning of the eliminated character's items is considered to be synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are discarded.

Effects that modify a character's body also modify the number an Orc or Troll would be discarded on. A maximum to body applies equally to the discard number.

If an Orc or Troll could be discarded and eliminated by a result, discard them instead of eliminating them.

"Affecting the body check" includes modifying the die roll or the body of the character making the check.

See also Movement/Hazard Phase, Combat, General.

### -= CCC =-

#### Cannot be Duplicated
Annotation 11 (modified from its original version): Some cards cannot be duplicated in limited cases -- generally on a specific target. Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated can be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being targeted by an effect that will discard it.

Short-events that cannot be duplicated cannot be played if a card of the same name is currently having an effect on play.

#### Card Effect Limitations
You may not play the following cards if your opponent is a Ringwraith or Sauron. Additionally, if you are not a Ringwraith or Sauron, a Ringwraith or Sauron opponent can play these cards against you and not be affected by any of their global effects.

 - All hazard events that require an agent\*
 - Bane of the Ithil-stone
 - The Black Enemy's Wrath
 - Foul Fumes
 - In the Heart of His Realm
 - Mordor in Arms
 - Mûmak
 - Worn and Famished

\* Near to Hear a Whisper and Sudden Fury from Middle- earth: Against the Shadow and Great Need or Purpose may be played because they do not target a specific agent.

The following cards are also listed in the MELE Rules book as having no effect on a Ringwraith/Sauron player, but this interpretation has been modified.

Chance of Being Lost and Winds of Wrath: You may play these cards against any opponent who is using the same type of location deck (hero sites or minion sites) as yourself.

Great Secrets Buried There: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or Sauron player.

The Nazgûl are Abroad: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or Sauron player. The only restriction is that the first two paragraphs are ignored when you play Nazgûl creatures against a Ringwraith or Sauron opponent. Any player can recycle Nazgûl hazards as stated on the card.

#### Challenge Decks
Page 12 should say that companies must join at non-Haven sites. Companies at Havens at the end of the movement/hazard phase may join or not as they choose.

The end-of-turn phase was left out of the rulesbook. During the end of turn phase you may discard one card, then you must reset to hand size.

In the Dwar deck (H) and the Indûr deck (J), the Arkenstone should have the icon for a play deck card, not a sideboard card.

Old Forest should read "healing effects," not "healing cards."

#### Character
A character enacting an effect counts as a character in his company, and may affect himself as a character in the company.

A character in play must always be in one of three independent states: untapped, tapped, or wounded.

You can have three of a non-unique character in your deck.

Prowess modifications due to tapped and wounded status apply only during the strike sequence.

See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Followers and Playing Characters.

#### Command Cards
Command cards return other command cards of the same name to your hand.

#### Company
If all characters in a company are removed from the company, all resource permanent-events played on the company as a whole are discarded.

If all characters in a company leave play, the site goes to the location deck or discard pile, depending on its tapped status. If this happens during the movement/hazard phase, the site card stays in play until the end of all movement/hazard phases. In this case, on-guard cards may still be played on the site.

The following allies make a company overt: The Balrog, Creature of an Older World, Great Bats, Great Lord of Goblin-gate, Last Child of Ungoliant, Regiment of Black Crows, and "Two- headed" Troll.

Entities associated with a company include the characters, allies, and items in the company, and any events played on the company or on another entity in the company. The new site and site of origin are not entities associated with the company.

A hero company is Wizard player's company, or a Fallen-wizard's company that has no Orcs or Trolls. A minion company is a Ringwraith player's company, or a Balrog player's company. An overt company is a company with Orcs and/or Trolls in it. Note that some allies can make a company overt, but Half-orcs do not.

See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Organizing Companies; and Rulings by Term, Influence.

#### Corruption
Rules Erratum: Corruption cards must always start a chain of effects. [Effective 8/27/98]

Annotation 23: When a character fails a corruption check, the standard effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or eliminated and his items being discarded) are implemented immediately and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g. The Precious), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., Traitor, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive condition of a failed check, take effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check.

Characters with 0 corruption points must still make corruption checks.

A character may attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping. The roll is at -3.

You can not attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping if you have attempted to remove that card already this turn. You may not tap to remove a corruption card that you tried to remove without tapping already this turn.

The resolution of a character tapping to give +1 to a corruption check happens when the corruption check itself resolves.

If an effect is in play that prevents a character from being discarded, the character is not considered to fail his corruption check if a result is achieved that would discard him. A Wizard would not be eliminated and his player would not lose the game.

A character attempting to remove a corruption card on another character may ignore the tapping requirement and recieve -3 to the roll.

See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Storing Items.

### -= DDD =-

#### Darkhaven
Rules Erratum: Attacks keyed to Darkhavens are detainment. [effective 11/17/97]

Whenever a hazard affecting heroes refers to a Darkhaven, interpret it as referring to a Haven instead.

Attacks at Darkhavens are canceled only if the company is at the Darkhaven.

Darkhavens count as their own nearest Darkhaven.

#### Detainment Attacks
When a strike from a detainment attack succeeds, the character who was facing that particular strike must tap.

Attacks that have special effects when they wound a character do not have that effect when they are detainment attacks. This is because detainment attacks never wound a character.

#### Discard
A discarded non-Wizard/non-Ringwraith character may be brought into play again by any player.

When a card is discarded, so are all permanent-events on that card.

Cards discarded from a player's hand must be discarded one at a time. This is mainly to allow a Pallando player to see each card as it is discarded.

Whenever a character is discarded, all non-follower cards played with that character are also discarded.

If a card leaves active play, including being returned to a player's hand, it immediately ceases having an effect on play. \[effective 11/3/97]

Cards in the discard pile do not remember how they were played.

#### Dragons
Dragon automatic-attacks are not considered manifestations of any unique Dragon.

If a manifestation of a unique Dragon is defeated, then the automatic- attack at the associated site is removed, and that site therefore loses its hoard status.

If you defeat the attack from a Dragon manifestation, you get kill marshalling points from the manifestation as if you had defeated a creature.

### -= EEE =-

#### Eliminated
When a card is eliminated, all permanent-events on that card are discarded.

#### Exhausted
Permanent-events discarded when the play deck is exhausted are shuffled into the new play deck along with the rest of the discard pile.

### -= FFF =-

#### Fallen-wizard
The white hand symbol on the Fallen-wizard card is that Fallen-wizard's general influence once he is revealed. Prior to that, his general influence is 20.

A Fallen-wizard may use a minion resource to cancel the automatic-attack at a hero site, and vice versa.

Fallen-wizards may not play characters with more than five mind, but if they have one in play the character is not discarded.

A Fallen-wizard is at -5 for influence attempts against a Ringwraith, but not against a Wizard.

Fallen-wizards may not use starter movement, but they may use any other form of movement.

Fallen-wizards use Ringwraith rules for agents.

You may not declare yourself as a specific Fallen-wizard unless you have his card in your deck.

Fallen-wizards can have a character with more than five mind, they just can't start with one or play one.

For starting companies, minor items come into play after characters, so they cannot affect a character's mind for the purpose of playing him.

When a site is replaced with a site of the opposite alignment, the new site comes into play in the same orientation as the other site.

You may use minion or hero resources to affect the automatic-attack at a site, regardless of the site's alignment.

If any version of a site is in play or in your discard pile, you may not play another version of that site.

Fallen-wizards may recieve one extra MP for factions played on a leader.

Fallen-wizards may not play Bade to Rule.

If you reveal your Fallen-wizard, and no longer have enough influence to controll your characters, discard other characters until you can control them all.

None of a Fallen-wizards MPs may be modified by non-stage resources.

See also Rulings by Term, Specific.

### -= GGG =-

#### Gold Ring Item
When a gold ring item is tested, the ring is discarded and its marshalling points are lost whether or not you are able to play a special item.

Ring special items played as a result of storing a ring at a Darkhaven come into play stored.

### -= HHH =-

#### Hand Size
Effects which increase your hand size or allow you to hold one more card in your hand mean that you draw up to your new hand size or discard down to it at the appropriate points during the game.

Effects which increase hand size are cumulative.

See also Card Errata and Rulings, Favor of the Valar.

#### Haven
Havens can tap. Whenever a hazard affecting minions refers to a Haven, interpret it as referring to a Darkhaven instead. Havens count as their own nearest Haven.

If two companies join at a Haven, cards played on the discarded version of the Haven transfer to the version of the Haven that stays in play.

#### Hobbits
If a Hobbit is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be brought back into play normally at Bag End.

### -= III =-

#### Influence
Restricted direct influence is limited in its use, usually to characters and/or factions of specific races. Unrestricted influence has no use restrictions.

When a character suffers a minus to direct influence, it must come from unrestricted direct influence first. If there is no unrestricted influence and there are multiple instances of restricted direct influence, the player may choose which restricted direct influence the minus is applied to.

A character removed from the control of direct influence outside the organization phase does not need to be controlled by general influence until that player's next organization phase.

Changes to general influence take place immediately, with a minimum of zero free general influence.

See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Followers and Organizing Companies; and Rulings by Term, Company.

#### Items

The "free" minor item may only be played immediately after playing the resource that taps that site.

### -= LLL =-

#### Leader
Factions played with a leader are worth two extra MP per group of factions, not per faction.

### -= MMM =-

#### Manifestations
A Fallen-wizard (nor any other player) may not have two resource manifestations of the same unique resource in his deck.

#### Marshalling Point Pile
Under standard rules, no more than half of your marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling point. Do not round up. The easiest way to deal with this is to set the category with the most marshalling points to equal the total of all other categories of marshalling points.

You may not target hazards in your opponent's marshalling point pile for removal.

You may not gain marshalling points from a hazard you played yourself.

#### May not Untap
Nothing may untap a character who is the subject of an effect that states the character may not untap.

#### MELE vs. METW

Hero items may not be used as conditions for minion resources, and minion items may not be used as conditions for hero resources. Note that a Fallen-wizard may play special ring items regardless of the alignment of the gold ring item tested.

\# If you are playing against a deck with three Wizards in it, you may play any combination of three Ringwraiths, except one each of three different Ringwraiths.

You may not have both the minion and hero version of a unique item in your deck.

#### Minion characters

Minion characters are not affected by cards that target agents.

#### Modes

When one mode effect is applied to a Ringwraith, all other cards applying a mode effect to that Ringwraith are discarded.

When a Ringwraith is in a mode, only apply the effects listed on the mode card, on the Ringwraith, and in the rules for that mode. Do not worry about cards that are not in play.

If an ally giving a mode is removed from play during the movement/hazard phase, the Ringwraith immediately stops being in that mode, but continues to move to his new site.

#### Multi-player Games

Only the moving player, and the hazard player drawing cards based on his movement, may take advantage of drawing cards, including cards drawn for events like The Nazgul are Abroad and From the Pits of Angband. These two players are also the only ones who may discard a card at the end of the turn.

All players reset their hand size when any turn or movement/hazard phase ends.

In multi-player games the following hazards count as 1/2 a creature: hazards that can be played as events or creatures, Ahunt Dragon manifestations, and At Home Dragon manifestations. Agents in a Wizard deck also count as 1/2 creatures.
You may only play The Lidless Eye if none of your opponents are Ringwraiths.

Twilight may only be played by the moving player and the hazard player. As an exception, a player who's own environment will be discarded by an environment may play Twilight to cancel that environment.

For Spying out the Land and Here is a Snake, each hazard player shows hazards immediately before he draws and/or plays hazards, and then can only play those hazards. Players who are not playing hazards are not required to show hazards.

Actions taken during the movement/hazard phase, against a specific player, must be done against the moving player.

### -= NNN =-

#### Normal

Normal means as written on the card, not considering other card's effects. Note that this definition only applies to effects refering to card texts.

#### Nazgûl

If a Nazgûl is tapped to become a short-event as printed on its card, it turns into a short-event upon declaration. At this point, the Nazgûl is a short-event just as if had been played as such from your hand.

The body referred to in the text of female characters with combat bonuses against Nazgûl is the body of the Nazgûl

### -= OOO =-

#### Off to the Side

Host cards of cards off to the side can be targeted normally.

#### Optional Rules

If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the character, the second strike is considered successful.
A character tapping to face two strikes is at -3 prowess against both strikes. The character taps when resolving the second strike.

For recently visited sites in multi-player games, the automatic-attack gets +1 for each player who has that site in their discard pile.

See also Rulings by Term, Burglary Attempts.

### -= PPP =-

#### Passive Conditions

A passive condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already in play.

Annotation 9: If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action is canceled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules.

Annotation 9a: If a card is required to be discarded by some passive condition, the card is discarded immediately when the condition resolves, not in the following chain of effects.

Annotation 10: If more than one action is required to be the first action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions have been declared.

A card causing an action as a result of a passive condition must be in play when the action resolves, or else the action is canceled.

#### Playing a Card

Playing a card is the process of bringing a card from your hand into play.

You may not play a card which has no effect on the game. Causing a dice roll is considered to be having an effect on the game.

### -= RRR =-

#### Reveal

Any revealed cards are shown to all players.

#### Ring Items

You should shuffle your deck after searching it for a Lesser Ring.

#### Ringwraith

You may have any number of Ringwraiths in your sideboard, as long as you do not duplicate more than one of them in the combined deck and sideboard.

Characters with combat bonuses against Nazgûl also get those bonuses against Ringwraiths. However, other effects that affect Nazgûl do not affect Ringwraiths.

Ringwraiths may not move from a non-Darkhaven site to another non- Darkhaven site unless they are using Dwar Unleashed. This means a Ringwraith may not move to Under-deeps sites that do not have a Darkhaven for a surface site.

#### Ringwraith Follower

Ringwraith followers may still use magic as printed on their card.

When your revealed Ringwraith leaves play without being eliminated, you have until the end of your next organization phase to bring your Ringwraith back into play, and use him to re-control any Ringwraith followers. Otherwise, all Ringwraith followers are discarded.

### -= SSS =-

#### Sage Only

Any card requiring a sage to play is a sage only card.

#### Short-event

Short-events are discarded when resolved in a chain of effects, not when declared. Thus, they can be targeted by certain special effects in the chain of effects.

#### Sideboard

The sideboard is increased to 30 cards for one and two-deck games, 35 for three-deck, and 40 for four-deck.

You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent's Wizard/Ringwraith is in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent's untap phase and then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgûl permanent-event to do so. The hazard limit against all of your opponent's companies that turn is halved, rounded up.

Tapping a Nazgûl to bring cards in from the sideboard does not turn the Nazgûl into a short-event. It is discarded immediately upon declaration.

You may have Wizards in your sideboard. You may have no more than three copies of one Wizard, and one copy of each other Wizard, in your sideboard and play deck combined.

You may access your sideboard when your opponent plays The Lidless Eye as if he had revealed his Ringwraith.

#### Site

To untap a site the character doing so must be at that site.

A permanent-event played on a site affects only the copy of the site it is played on, unless otherwise specified. A permanent-event not played on a site affects all versions of affected sites.

Hero events cannot target or affect minion sites, and vice versa. News of the Shire is an exception.

#### Site Path
Certain cards refer to the site's site path. The site's site path is always the site path given on the site card, regardless of how the company got to that site.

Events can alter both a site's site path and a company's site path.

#### Skill Cards
Two or more skill cards may be played by a single character outside of the strike sequence.

Two skill cards may not be declared by one character against a given strike.

"(Foo) only" cards can only be played by characters with the (foo) skill.

#### Specific

To play a name-specific card, you must have declared yourself as the character with that name. That character need not be in play.

#### Stage Resources

If your opponent is playing the same Fallen-wizard as you, and reveals that Fallen-wizard first, you must discard any Fallen-wizard specific stage resources that you have in play.

Wizard specific Stage Resources may be played with the starting company.

Stored stage resources give stage points, and may be discarded normally.

If you start with Hidden Haven, you must bring out your stating site when you reveal Hidden Haven.

#### Stored Cards
Stored cards are not considered to be in play, except for uniqueness.

Stored cards get no bonuses based on who bears them.

See also Rulings by Term, Stage Resource.

### -= TTT =-

#### Targets
A target is an entity that an action is played out through. Enitities are only targets of an action if the action specifies those entities by number and type. Note that "the foo" counts as specifying one "foo."

Annotation 1: A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g. a corruption check.

Annotation 2: A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared.

Annotation 3: Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they generally affect an entire class of things.

Annotation 4: An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-guard cards.

You cannot target an opponent's character or resources with your own resources.

A card that is played on a card continuously targets the card it is on.

See also Rulings by Term, Active Condition.

#### Timing
The validity of an effect, including the hazard limit, is checked upon declaration and upon resolution.

Annotation 24: If a card specifies that more than one action occurs when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all of these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed.

(amendment to original version of Annotation 24): As an exception, if one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the strike sequence--see Annotation 18 (Turn Sequence, Movement/ Hazard Phase, Combat, Strike Sequence).

Annotation 27 : If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for the choice of effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discarded. The player may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect of the card.

#### Trophies

Creatures whose marshalling points are listed with an \* give marshalling points while used as trophies.

Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies, including Dragon factions.

Trophies can be discarded to satisfy "thieving" attacks, and count as items for all other effects.

Characters may not be taken as trophies

Trophies in Fallen-wizard companies give prowess and influence bonuses based on the MPs printed on the card.

### -= UUU =-

#### Under-deeps

Marshalling points with companies at or moving from an Under-deeps site do not count for the purposes of calling the Free Council. They do count at the Council. This includes minion and Fallen-wizard companies.

When a company's site of origin is an Under-deeps site and the company reveals a new site at the start of its movement/hazard phase, the company is declaring it will make a roll to determine if the movement was successful. No cards can be played between the site being revealed and the roll except for Reach of Ulmo. Neither player draws cards for this movement if the roll is not successful.

At an Under-deeps site, after a successful rescue attempt, a character can tap for a minor item only.

Automatic-attacks that allow the revealing of creature cards are not stopped by Stealth or Secret Entrance.

Creatures revealed as automatic-attacks do not count as creatures.

@ With the addition of the sites in Balrog, Windthrone is now always a surface site of an underdeeps.

### -= WWW =-

#### Wizard

\# You may put two of the same Wizard in your deck, or you may put one copy each of two different Wizards in your deck.

#### Wizardhaven

A Wizardhaven is not considered to be adjacent to an Under-deeps site unless Deep Mines has been played on it.

Protected Wizardhavens do not allow you to move an extra region with region movement.

The phrase 'protected Wizardhaven' is just a keyword, and has no effect by itself.

If you are influencing against your opponent, and he is at a Wizardhaven where you can not play cards that give MPs, you can reveal the card you are influencing against to reduce the number you roll against to 0, but you may not play that card afterwards (if it gives MPs).

## Tournament Rulings
Tournament rulings are modifications and additions to the rules presented in
the Unlimited Edition of the Rulebook that are required for sanctioned Council of Lorien
tournament play.

&emsp;[General](#general-4)
&emsp;[The Character Draft](#the-character-draft)
&emsp;[Deck Construction](#deck-construction)
&emsp;[Freeze the Flesh](#freeze-the-flesh)
&emsp;[Great Secrets Buried There](#great-secrets-buried-there)
&emsp;[Movement](#movement-1)
&emsp;[Sites](#sites)
&emsp;[Starting Companies](#starting-companies)
&emsp;[Victory Conditions](#victory-conditions)
&emsp;[The Weakest Link Method](#the-weakest-link-method)
 
#### General
 Dice must be used to obtain random numbers.
 
 There is a required 30 card minimum for both resources
and hazards for sanctioned
tournament play.

 All Ringwraith/Sauron players always have +5 unused
general influence at all times. This
bonus general influence can never be used to control
characters.

You may not shuffle your discard pile unless a game
effect requires it.

To randomly access a card or cards from your discard
pile, shuffle it and draw the
required number of cards from the pile. The remaining
cards become your new discard pile.

#### The Character Draft
 The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.
 
 Each player reveals one character at a time from their
pool, simultaneously with their
opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into the starting
companies, duplicated characters
are put aside and not allowed in either starting company.
Each player continues until they
want to stop, they have 20 points of mind in their
starting company, or they have five
characters in their starting company.

 Ringwraith players may start with 6 characters in the
character draft
 If one player stops revealing characters, the other one
may continue to reveal characters.

 No player may reveal a character that would bring his
starting company's total mind over 20.

 When players are finished, each may put up to 10
characters into their deck, including
characters from his starting pool that did not end up in
the starting company.

 Characters left over from the character pool may be
placed either in the play deck, or out of
play, but may not be placed in the sideboard.

#### Deck Construction
 Cards that can be played as either hazards or resources
may count as either for purposes of
deck construction.

 Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.
 
 The following count as 1/2 a creature for deck
construction: hazards that can be played as
creatures or events, At Home Dragon manifestations, Ahunt
Dragon manifestations, and
agents. Note that agents count as characters in
Ringwraith decks, not as 1/2 creatures.

 Up to 3 copies of one Wizard or Ringwraith is allowed in
a play deck, or up to 2 copies of
one and 1 copy of another. One copy each of three
different Wizards or Ringwraiths is not
allowed.

 You may place Ringwraiths or Wizards in your sideboard,
as long as only one of them is
duplicated in the deck and sideboard combined, and you
have only Ringwraiths or only
Wizards in the deck and sideboard combined.

 You may include hero items in a Ringwraith deck even in a
Ringwraith vs. Ringwraith
game.

 A Fallen-wizard may only count two Twilights as
resources, the third must be counted as a
hazard. The same goes for other hazards that may be
played as resources.

 The two starting minor items must be chosen before the
character draft, and must be the
same for every game in the tournament.

#### Freeze the Flesh
 If used on your Ringwraith or Fallen-wizard, it will
remove the -5 MP penalty for having
them eliminated.

#### Great Secrets Buried There
 If you play this card as a hazard on your opponent, you
must be able to provide your
opponent with a copy of any uncommon Under-deeps sites if
he does not have a copy in his
location deck.

 If you give an Under-deeps site to your opponent, it will
return to your location deck when
he is done with it, unless you have also used the site,
in which case it returns to your discard
pile.

#### Movement
 Maps of the regions of MECCG may be used in place of
region cards in Council of Lorien
tournaments. If two or more companies move on the same
turn, then each company does not
have to determine the site path to its new site until the
beginning of it's movement/hazard
phase.

 Wizard companies cannot use starter movement to or from
sites in Gorgoroth. If using
region movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth, they must
move from a site in Imlad Morgul,
through either Nurn or Udun, or use a movement enhancer
like Ash Mountains or
Eagle-mounts. Such sites may be reached normally with
Under-deeps movement.

#### Sites
 If you play a hazard forcing a Fallen-wizard to change
site alignments, and he does not have
the other version of the site he is moving to, you must
provide it for him. After that it is his
responsibility to provide sites.

#### Starting Companies
 Ringwraith/Sauron players may have starting companies at
Dol Guldur and/or Minas Morgul.

A Ringwraith may also be brought into play at Dol
Guldur, Minas Morgul, or his home site.

#### Victory Conditions
 Eliminating a Wizard or Ringwraith does not end the game.
An eliminated Wizard or
Ringwraith is placed in the out-of-play pile, and
gives -5 MP to the final total. That player
may not reveal another Wizard or Ringwraith. This
includes Wizards who fail corruption
checks. \[effective 1/1/98]

 The -5 MPs apply immediately, and affect your MPs for
calling the end fo the game.

 If your Fallen-wizard dies, you may not play cards
specific to that Fallen-wizard, and you do
not count as that Fallen-wizard for card effects such as
Gatherer of Loyalties.

#### The Weakest Link Method
 If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption
point to each non-Wizard character in
play. All characters then make corruption checks. After
all corruption checks, recount
marshalling points.

 Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all
non-Wizard characters are corrupted
away.

 - The _MEWH_ hand rules need errata. They should read that "a Fallen-wizard must not use starter movement," not that they may only use region movement. This means they can use Under-deeps movement, and cards like _Belegaer_.
 - Forcing a dice roll is considered to be having an effect on the game. This means you can play _Muster_ or _Weariness of the Heart_, even if there is no chance of the card doing anything.

#### Rulings Effective 12/6/97
 - Agents count as both characters and hazards during the game in a Ringwraith deck.

#### Rulings Effective 12/1/97
 - _No Escape from My Magic_, Card Erratum: Change "Playable on any faction in play" to "Playable on any unique faction in play."
 - Ringwraiths may not move from a non-Darkhaven site to another non-Darkhaven site unless they are using _Dwar Unleashed_. This means a Ringwraith may not move to Under-deeps sites that do not have a Darkhaven for a surface site.

#### Rulings Effective 11/17/97
 - Removing the site of origin and resetting to hand size are simultaneous actions, and they are the last actions in any movement/hazard phase. This means a moving company is not at a site until the site phase.
 - Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an effect, and this does not count against the hazard limit unless specified otherwise on the card.
 - Rules Erratum: Attacks keyed to Darkhavens are detainment.
 - _Gates of Morning_ discards hazard environments when it resolves, even if _Peril Returned_ is in play.
 - _Iron Shield of Old_: Card Erratum: Add "_Shield._"

#### Rulings Effective 11/3/97
 - If a card leaves active play, including being returned to a player's hand, it immediately ceases having an effect on play.
 - _Stay Her Appetite_: Card Erratum: Change "plus two" to "plus five."
