Hi,

I failed to change the @ symbols when I posted the CRF. I will correct that
ASAP. In the mean time, here are all the changes:

Changes for MECCG CRF 15

Turn Sequence Ruling-Movement/Hazard Phase-Movement-Returning to Site of
Origin
ERRATA: If a company returns to its site of origin, it may do nothing during
it's site phase. A company failing it underdeeps movement roll is not
effected by this rule.

Turn Sequence Ruling-Site Phase-Company Vs. Company Combat
ERRATA: Hazard effects in play that affect attacks have no effect on company
vs. company combat. (This replaces the CRF entry, "Hazards have no effect on
company vs. company combat.)

Turn Sequence Ruling-Site Phase-Influence Attempts
Change "It is not possible to influence an item away from a Wizard or
Ringwraith." to "It is not possible to influence anything away from a Wizard
or Ringwraith."

Turn Sequence Ruling-Site Phase-On-Guard Cards
Add: If the site an on-guard card is played upon leaves play before the site
phase, the on-guard cards at that site return to their owner's hand.

Rulings by Term - Balrog
ERRATA: Balrog players receive no Marshaling Points for hero items played at
their darkhavens.

Rulings by Term - Underdeeps
With the addition of the sites in Balrog, Windthrone is now always the
surface site of an underdeeps.

Card Rulings - A Strident Spawn
Add, ERRATA: Unique.

Card Ruling - Long Grievous Siege
There must be an eligible borderhold for this card to be played.

Card Ruling - River
You must tap one ranger for each river played on the site.

Card Ruling - Fortress of Isen: Remove "A company moving to or from Isengard
is not
considered to be moving through Gap of Isen (including one less Border-
land in their site path)."

Card Ruling - Fortress of the Towers: Remove: "A company moving to or from
The Wither Towers is not considered to be moving through ARthedain
(including one
less Wilderness in their site path)."

Card Ruling - Guarded Haven: Remove "A company moving to or from this site
is not
considered to be moving through the region containing the site (including
one less of its region type in their site path)."

Card Ruling - Palantir of Elostirion: This item does not give MPs to a
Fallen-wizard,
regardless of other cards in play.

Card Ruling - Palantir of Orthanc: This item does not give MPs to a
Fallen-wizard,
regardless of other cards in play.

Card Ruling - Rhosgobel: Remove "Any of your companies moving to or from
Rhosgobel is not considered to be moving through Southern Mirkwood
(including one less Dark-domain in their site path)."

Introduction
This is version 15 of the collected clarifications to the rules for the
Middle- earth: Collectible
Card Game, up to May 29, 1999; including up to digest 578 of the mailing
list. Some of these
clarifications are considered errata to the rules or cards, and are noted as
such. The Turn
Sequence and Rulings by Term sections are specifically considered
clarifications to the rules, and
are therefore overridden by card text that specifically does so. A complete
list of errata is
included. There will be periodic updates to this file, and items marked with
a "@" are new or
changed since the last version.
New rulings that clarify ambiguous situtations take effect immediately.
Reversals of old rulings,
changes to the rules, and new rulings not covering ambiguous situations will
not have an effect
on tournament play until two to four weeks after they are made. Every other
Monday, starting
November 3, 1997, will be a Rulings Monday. On a Rulings Monday, delayed
rulings that have
been made will be announced on the internet, and rulings that were announced
on the previous
Rulings Monday will take effect.
The main thing to remember, when making rulings based on the rules and the
cards, is that if it
isn't there, then it isn't there. If a card says a site counts as a Haven
for purposes of healing, that
does not mean the site counts as a Haven for any other purposes. If a card
says it can be played as
a resource, that does not mean it counts as a resource at any time except
when it is being played.
Remember: If it isn't there, it isn't there.
Tournament rules for MECCG differ slightly from the rules for casual play.
Rulings marked with
a "#" differ from those in tournament play. When playing in a tournament, be
sure to check the
Tournament Rulings section.

 Free Council
Beginning of the Game
 # If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in
the starting company, then it does not
count against the 10 character limit.
 # You should either draw numbers for the whole game or
roll dice for the whole game.
 Your starting company can only contain 20 points of
unmodified mind.
 Non-character cards duplicated in the character draft may
not be placed into the play deck.
 Your staring hand is eight cards, regardless of what
characters you have at particular sites.
Untap Phase
 Corruption checks triggered at the end of the untap phase
happen after everyone untaps.
Organization Phase
Choosing a New Site
 Rules Erratum: When a company splits, any of the
resulting companies can move with
region movement. Region movement is not limited to one
company of a split.
 Any single site path cannot have more than one copy of a
particular region.
 Any company may declare as its new site a site already on
the table. That site will remain on
the table at least until the end of that company's
movement/hazard phase.
 Two companies may not start at the same site of origin
and move to the same new site.
 Effects that are played during the organization phase,
and depend on the site or site path of a
moving company, create an effect which is not declared
until the new site is revealed. If the
site or site path is not of the appropriate type when the
effect resolves, the resource has no
effect. If the company has multiple movement/hazard
phases on the same turn, the card
applies separately to each phase, having an effect only
if the correct conditions are met.
Followers
 A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence
against "Blue Mountain Dwarves" to
control characters with the home site Blue Mountain
Dwarf-hold. The bonus only applies to
the faction.
 Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only
once, not for each character.
Organizing Companies
 When a company splits up, its player chooses which
characters are the original company and
which characters are a new company, unless otherwise
directed by a card. All resource
permanent-events played on the original company stay with
the original company.
 Company composition changes that you choose to make,
including bringing a character into
play, must all be done at the same time during the
organization phase. During this time no
other actions may be taken.
 If a company splits, all but one of the split companies
must attempt to move to a different
site this turn. The company may not rejoin in the same
phase.
 You may transfer a character from one company at a site
to another, without creating a third
company.
 See also Rulings by Term, Company and Influence.
Playing Characters
 Rules Erratum: You may play a character if you do not
have enough influence to control
them. However, if there are any characters you do not
have the influence to control at the
end of your organization phase, the character you brought
into play this turn must be
returned to your hand.
 If you play a Ringwraith at a non-Darkahven site where
there is one of your non-Ringwraith
comapnies, one of the companies must move that turn. If
both companies are still there at
the end of the movement/hazard phase, discard the
non-Rinwraith company. [Effective
11/17/97]
Storing Items
 Minions who roll equal to or one less than their
accumulated corruption when storing an
item are only tapped.
 A minion who taps from a corruption check for
storing/transferring an item still successfully
stores/transfers that item.
Long Event Phase
Movement/Hazard Phase
General
 Annotation 25: A company is considered to be at the site
given by its site card at all times
except from the moment their new site card is revealed
during their movement/hazard phase
until their old site card is discarded during the same
movement/hazard phase. During this
period a company is considered to be en route between
sites and not at any site.
 Annotation 25a: A company's movement/hazard phase is
concluded when a moving
company removes its site of origin and both players agree
to reconcile (discard down
to/draw up to) their hand sizes. No resources (and
obviously no hazards) can be played, and
no resource effects can be activated, until the site
phase or until both players have drawn
cards for the movement of a following company.
 Annotation 25b: Players drawing cards when a new site is
revealed is synonymous with the
resolution of the new site being revealed. It happens
immediately, not in the following chain
of effects.
 Annotation 26: If at the start of a player's
movement/hazard phase, there are multiple
effects in play such that their net effect depends on the
order they are applied, the player
who is currently not taking his turn (i.e., the hazard
player) decides the order in which they
are to be applied. Once this interpretation is
established, all further actions are applied in the
order they are resolved for the rest of the turn.
 Once the effects of an environment card have been applied
to a target during a given
movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again
to that target during the current turn.

 When you draw cards for movement, you may continue
drawing cards until you either want
to stop, or have drawn the number of cards allowed for
the movement.
 Companies at the same non-Haven/non-Darkhaven site must
join at the end of all
movement/hazard phases, before the site phase starts.
Companies at the same
Haven/Darkhaven site may join at this time.
 If companies would join at the end of the movement/hazard
phase such that the company
composition rules are violated, one company of the hazard
player's choice must return to its
site of origin.
 If two companies join at a site, cards affecting one of
the companies now affect them both.
 Removing the site of origin and resetting to hand size
are simultaneous actions, and they are
the last actions in any movement/hazard phase. This means
a moving company is not at a
site until the site phase. [effective 11/17/97]
 The same region (as in region card) may not occur twice
in a single site path.
 A non-moving company's current site is considered its new
site for card play.
Movement
General
 If a company does not move, it still has a
movement/hazard phase. No cards are drawn
based on the company's movement, and the only hazards
that can be played on the company
are creatures that can be keyed to the company's site and
events.
 Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they
look that way on some maps.
 If a company moves twice in one turn, resources played
during the organization phase, like
Secret Passage, are reapplied to the company at the
beginning of each of their
movement/hazard phases, if the conditions of the card are
met.
 If both players have access to region movement, then
neither player may be stopped from
using region movement. Access includes region cards or an
appropriate map.
Playing Hazards
 Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard
them for an effect, and this does
not count against the hazard limit unless specified
otherwise on the card. [effective 11/17/97]
 Hazards may only be played on a company whose
movement/hazard phase is being resolved,
or on the site they are moving to. Long-events and
permanent- events may effect more than
one company even though they are only played "on" one
company.
 If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a
region type, those region types do not
have to be consecutive in the site path.
 If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent
plays a resource before the
movement/hazard phase ends, you may then resume playing
hazards, assuming you have not
yet reached the hazard limit.
 If a company is moving from a surface site to an
Under-deeps site, hazards may not be
played keyed to the region of the surface site.
 Angmar Arises, In Darkness Bind Them, and Reaching Shadow
may not be used to play
creatures keyed to double shadow-lands.
 A creature "played at" a site is the same as being "keyed
to" the site.
 A creature "played at a site in" a region is the same as
being "keyed to" the site by name.
 For the purposes of interpreting hazards, no Darkhaven or
Haven has a site path except for
Geann a-Lisch.
 You check the hazard limit at declaration and resolution.
At declaration there must be less
hazards already declared than the hazard limit. At
resolution there must be no more hazards
declared than the hazard limit.
Returning to Site of Origin
 If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path
immediately disappears, and its
movement/hazard phase immediately ends.
 An effect that returns a company to its site of origin
may not be declared in the middle of an
attack.
 @ Rules Erratum: If a company returns to it's site of
origin, it may do nothing during it's site
phase. A company failing it's underdeeps movement roll is
not effected by this rule.
Combat
General
 Side effects of losing a character are resolved
immediately after the character is lost, before
other characters resolve their strikes.
 All strikes of an attack must be assigned before any are
resolved.
 See also Rulings by Term, Ally and Body Check; and
Turn Sequence, Site Phase, Company
vs. Company Combat.
Attack
 Annotation 12: An attack is considered to be resolved and
concluded when the final strike,
all special actions resulting from the final strike, and
the associated body check are resolved.

 Annotation 13: An attack may not be canceled once its
strikes have been assigned. A strike
may not be canceled once the dice-roll for the strike has
been made.
 Annotation 14: A canceled attack has no effect on its
target company, except that the
company is considered in its history to have faced the
attack.
 Annotation 15: An attack must be the first declared
action in a chain of effects, i.e., a
creature card may not be played in response to another
card in the same chain of effects.
Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception.
 In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an
attack, the character doing so must be in
the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site
type a hazard creature was keyed to
can be affected otherwise.
 Cards only modify attacks if they say they specifically
mention attacks.
 When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the
MPs, the creature goes to the
out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played the
attack. They may still be taken as a
trophy, but go to the appropriate out-of-play pile when
the trophy is discarded.
 Excess strikes applied as -1 modifiers do not have to
have their body defeated.
 If an attack states all characters in a company face a
strike, then effects which allow a
character to face more than one strike have no effect
against the attack. Similarly, effects
that change the attack's number of strikes have no
effect. As an exception, effects which
reduce the number of strikes to a specific number do
work.
 Any effect that would change the number of strikes for an
attack may not be played after
strikes are assigned. This includes cards that have other
additional effects, and cards that
only indirectly change the number of strikes.
 Attacks created by events are not keyed to anything
unless specifically stated as being keyed
to something on the card.
 There are three levels of cards which reassign strikes.
Alatar is the top level, and overrides
any other conflicting card which changes the assignment
of strikes. Cards which say they
"always" or "in all cases" change the assignment of
strikes are the next level, and override
any other conflicting effects except Alatar. Cards which
say they change the assignment of
strikes "regardless of ..." certain factors are the
third level, and are overridden by all other
effects from conflicting cards. If two effects on the
same level conflict, the resource
overrides the hazard.
 If an attack can not be cancelled, strikes from the
attack may still be cancelled.
 An attack is considered faced by a company if it
successfully resolves in its chain of effects.
 Attacks or strikes keyed by name to a region or site
cannot be cancelled by effects which
refer only to the type of the region or site.
The Strike Sequence
 Annotation 16: When a wounded character becomes
unwounded, he is considered in his
history to have been wounded and must face any special
actions the wounding strike
presented him.
 Annotation 17: The only actions that may be declared
during a strike sequence are those
outlined in Annotation 18.
 Annotation 18: When a defending player chooses to resolve
a strike against a particular
character, the only actions that may be taken by either
player until the strike dice-roll is
made are the following: playing hazard cards that affect
the strike, the attacker may decide
to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications due
to strikes in excess of the company's
size, a target untapped character may take a -3
modification so that he will not automatically
tap, and the defending character may play resource cards
that affect the strike. An action that
has the condition that a target character tap, but
which otherwise has an effect not outlined
here, may not be declared at this point. This is true
even if the recipient of the strike would
be the target character tapping and thus receive -1 to
his prowess.
 Annotation 19: Following each successful strike or failed
strike, a body check must be
rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However,
if the strike calls for any special
actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by
"William" may be required to discard his
items), these special actions are resolved before the
body check. The body check is the first
declared action in a nested chain of effects that
immediately follows the strike dice-roll and
special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions
may be declared in response to a body
check, in the same chain of effects, but these are
limited to those actions that directly affect
the body check dice- roll. E.g., Tookish Blood could
not be declared in response to the body
check caused by Giant Spiderswounding a Hobbit. No action
may be declared in response to a
special action resulting from a strike unless the
special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a
special action is generally considered synonymous with
the strike dice-roll. If the special
action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be
declared in response to it if the action
directly affects the dice-roll.
 Annotation 20: If more than one special action is to
follow a strike, the defending player
decides the order they are resolved.
 Annotation 21: A successful strike against a character is
synonymous with that character
being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the
playing surface is not a separate action
from the successful strike.
 Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general,
wounded characters are not
considered tapped.
 Non-item prowess bonuses are applied in the order the
player controlling the character
decides.
 If a character is facing two strikes, and the first
strike kills the character, the second strike is
considered successful.
 There is time between the strike sequences to take
actions that are otherwise legal.
Site Phase
General
 Items, factions and allies must be played during the site
phase.
 There is no one resource card per site phase rule.
However, the tapping of the site usually
limits you to one card per site phase.
 The site taps upon successful play of the resource that
would tap it.
 A company may not play any resource during the site phase
until they have faced all
automatic-attacks, unless that resource directly affects
an automatic-attack. Removing an
automatic-attack does not directly affect it, although
cancelling does.
 You may only play a free minor item after playing an
ally, faction, or item that taps the site.
 See also Rulings by Term, Item.
 Play of an ally, item, faction, or resource card which
will normally tap the site must be after
the company resolves all automatic, agentm and on-guard
creature attacks.
Company vs. Company Combat
 The defender may take actions that affect the attack or
any of the strikes. The attacker may
only take actions that affect individual strikes.
 True F na and Sacrifice of Form cannot be used in company
versus company combat.
 @ Rules Erratum: Hazards effects in play that affect
attacks have no effect on company vs.
company combat.
 Only the defender is considered to be facing an attack,
but all characters are considered to be
facing strikes.
 Tapped defending characters choose their strikes after
untapped attacking characters have
assigned their strikes.
 Minion and hero companies can attack each other. Hero
companies may not attack each
other. A Fallen Wizard covert company is considered a
hero company.
 See also Card Rulings, Swarm of Bats.
Automatic-attacks
 A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an
automatic-attack, and this counts as facing the
automatic-attack.
 Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the
normal automatic- attacks for the site.
Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in the order listed
and/or resolved.
 Company composition and overt/covert status is checked
before each automatic attack.
 Any character may tap to cancel one automatic-attack at
his home site.
 The only resources you may play against automatic-attacks
are ones that cancel the attack,
cancel a strike, or would be otherwise playable during
the strike sequence.
Influence Attempts
 @ It is not possible to influence anything away from a
Wizard or Ringwraith.
 You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.
 A successful influence attempt on an opponent's resource
does not tap the site.
 You may only make one influence attempt against your
opponent's resources during each
turn.
 When influencing factions across alignments, you roll
against the number on the card in
play, that you are trying to influence away.
 For a Fallen-wizard, the resource revealed must match the
alignment of the site at which the
attempt is taking place.
On-Guard Cards
 Rules Erratum: An on-guard card may only be revealed if
it could have also been played
during the movement/hazard phase. This means all targets
of the card must have existed
during the movement/hazard phase in order for the card to
be revealed.
 A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as
though it were both declared and
resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects during
which it was revealed.
 An on-guard card may be revealed when the company plays a
resource that potentially taps
the site. The card must affect the company or a character
in the company that site phase.
Note that this clarification is looser than the rule
printed on p.61 of the Unlimited Rules
book
 A successful ring test does not allow an on-guard card to
be revealed.
 You may reveal a card in response to an influence attempt
against a faction even if the
on-guard card only has an effect if the attempt is
successful. You may also reveal a card in
response to such an attempt that affects the actual
influence attempt.
 Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be
considered when determining the
validity of revealing an on-guard card. Potential effects
that have not been triggered cannot
be considered.
 A card cannot be revealed that:
Returns a company to its site of origin.
Taps a company's site.
Potentially removes a character from a company,
besides combat or corruption checks.
Forces a company to do nothing during its site
phase.
Directly taps a character in the company.

 A card that potentially removes an ally from the company
can be revealed, so long as it
otherwise is legal.
 The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's
hand.
 When an on-guard card is revealed, it immediately ceases
to be considered an on-guard card.

 Creatures may only be revealed on-guard if there is an
automatic-attack at the site.
 If two companies are at a Haven, on-guard cards played on
one company can only be
revealed against that company, and can only affect that
company (unless the hazard states it
affects all versions of the site).
 @ If the site an on-guard card is played on leaves play
before the site phase, the on-guard
cards are returned to their owner's hand.
 See also Rulings By Term, Burglary Attempts.
End-of-Turn Phase
 End-of-turn effects are triggered by the ending of the
End-of-Turn phase. Once both players
are done with all actions in the End-of-Turn phase, all
End-of-Turn effects are declared and
resolved in the order chosen by the current player. No
further actions may be declared that
turn.
 Cards may be played during the End-of-Turn phase after
hand size has been reconciled.
 Replacing one site with another at the end of the turn
counts as movement, without a
movement/hazard phase.
End-of-Game
 These rulings apply to any end game, whether it is the
Free Council, the Audience with
Sauron, or the Day of Reckoning.
 Characters may tap to aid corruption checks, if they are
in the same company.
 Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have
an effect.
 Only resources that directly affect corruption checks may
be played during the Free Council.
This includes cards that reduce a character's corruption
point total or prevent a character
from being discarded.
 When determining if more than half of your marshalling
points come from one type of
marshalling point, ignore negative marshalling points.
The easy way to do this is if one
category is more than half of your positive marshalling
points, reduce that category to equal
all of your other positive marshalling point categories
combined.
 To calculate marshalling points at the Free Council,
follow these steps:
Total up the marshalling points for each
category. The modifications from My
Precious, factions played on a
leader, and eliminated characters apply now.
If your opponent has no points in a category
double your points in that category.
Doubling does not apply to the Miscellaneous or
Kill categories.
If one of your categories accounts for more than
half of your positive marshalling point
total, reduce it so that it has the same
number of points as the rest of your positive
categories combined.
Subtract any points that are subtracted from your
total, including points from unique
resources your opponent has duplicated in his
hand.

Tournament Rulings
Tournament rulings are modifications and additions to the rules presented in
the Unlimited
Edition of the Rulebook that are required for sanctioned Council of L rien
tournament play.
Table of Contents
 General
 The Character Draft
 Deck Construction
 Freeze the Flesh
 Great Secrets Buried There
 Movement
 Sites
 Starting Companies
 Victory Conditions
 The Weakest Link Method
General
 Dice must be used to obtain random numbers.
 There is a required 30 card minimum for both resources
and hazards for sanctioned
tournament play.
 All Ringwraith/Sauron players always have +5 unused
general influence at all times. This
bonus general influence can never be used to control
characters.
 @ You may not shuffle your discard pile unless a game
effect requires it.
 @ To randomly access a card or cards from your discard
pile, shuffle it and draw the
required number of cards from the pile. The remaining
cards become your new discard pile.
The Character Draft
 The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.
 Each player reveals one character at a time from their
pool, simultaneously with their
opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into the starting
companies, duplicated characters
are put aside and not allowed in either starting company.
Each player continues until they
want to stop, they have 20 points of mind in their
starting company, or they have five
characters in their starting company.
 Ringwraith players may start with 6 characters in the
character draft
 If one player stops revealing characters, the other one
may continue to reveal characters.
 No player may reveal a character that would bring his
starting company's total mind over 20.

 When players are finished, each may put up to 10
characters into their deck, including
characters from his starting pool that did not end up in
the starting company.
 Characters left over from the character pool may be
placed either in the play deck, or out of
play, but may not be placed in the sideboard.
Deck Construction
 Cards that can be played as either hazards or resources
may count as either for purposes of
deck construction.
 Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.
 The following count as 1/2 a creature for deck
construction: hazards that can be played as
creatures or events, At Home Dragon manifestations, Ahunt
Dragon manifestations, and
agents. Note that agents count as characters in
Ringwraith decks, not as 1/2 creatures.
 Up to 3 copies of one Wizard or Ringwraith is allowed in
a play deck, or up to 2 copies of
one and 1 copy of another. One copy each of three
different Wizards or Ringwraiths is not
allowed.
 You may place Ringwraiths or Wizards in your sideboard,
as long as only one of them is
duplicated in the deck and sideboard combined, and you
have only Ringwraiths or only
Wizards in the deck and sideboard combined.
 You may include hero items in a Ringwraith deck even in a
Ringwraith vs. Ringwraith
game.
 A Fallen-wizard may only count two Twilights as
resources, the third must be counted as a
hazard. The same goes for other hazards that may be
played as resources.
 The two starting minor items must be chosen before the
character draft, and must be the
same for every game in the tournament.
Freeze the Flesh
 If used on your Ringwraith or Fallen-wizard, it will
remove the -5 MP penalty for having
them eliminated.
Great Secrets Buried There
 If you play this card as a hazard on your opponent, you
must be able to provide your
opponent with a copy of any uncommon Under-deeps sites if
he does not have a copy in his
location deck.
 If you give an Under-deeps site to your opponent, it will
return to your location deck when
he is done with it, unless you have also used the site,
in which case it returns to your discard
pile.
Movement
 Maps of the regions of MECCG may be used in place of
region cards in Council of L rien
tournaments. If two or more companies move on the same
turn, then each company does not
have to determine the site path to its new site until the
beginning of it's movement/hazard
phase.
 Wizard companies cannot use starter movement to or from
sites in Gorgoroth. If using
region movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth, they must
move from a site in Imlad Morgul,
through either Nurn or Ud n, or use a movement enhancer
like Ash Mountains or
Eagle-mounts. Such sites may be reached normally with
Under-deeps movement.
Sites
 If you play a hazard forcing a Fallen-wizard to change
site alignments, and he does not have
the other version of the site he is moving to, you must
provide it for him. After that it is his
responsibility to provide sites.
Starting Companies
 Ringwraith/Sauron players may have starting companies at
Dol Guldur and/or Minas Morgul.
A Ringwraith may also be brought into play at Dol
Guldur, Minas Morgul, or his home site.
Victory Conditions
 Eliminating a Wizard or Ringwraith does not end the game.
An eliminated Wizard or
Ringwraith is placed in the out-of-play pile, and
gives -5 MP to the final total. That player
may not reveal another Wizard or Ringwraith. This
includes Wizards who fail corruption
checks. [effective 1/1/98]
 The -5 MPs apply immediately, and affect your MPs for
calling the end fo the game.
 If your Fallen-wizard dies, you may not play cards
specific to that Fallen-wizard, and you do
not count as that Fallen-wizard for card effects such as
Gatherer of Loyalties.
The Weakest Link Method
 If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption
point to each non-Wizard character in
play. All characters then make corruption checks. After
all corruption checks, recount
marshalling points.
 Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all
non-Wizard characters are corrupted
away.

 If an attack from Assassin is given more than one strike,
each additional strike becomes an
excess strike (-1 prowess modification) against the
attacked character. An Assassincan never

 Beater and Biter increases the bonus the weapon gives, so
maximums on the weapon still

Andrast Coast, Bay of Belfalas, or Mouths of the Anuin."
Cracks of Doom
 Card Erratum: Add "Only playable during the site phase."
Remove "Otherwise, discard The
One Ring."

necessarily require you to play a Dragon later in the
turn.

canceled." with "Otherwise, the attack is
canceled and the opponent must reveal his hand."
