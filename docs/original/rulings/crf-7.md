# Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game

Collected Official Rulings File
{: .text-center .text-beta}

Version 7 current as of September 15th, 1997.
{: .text-center }

## READ THIS FIRST

The main thing to remember, when making rulings based on the rules and the cards, is that if it isn't there, then it isn't there. If a card says a site counts as a Haven for purposes of healing, that does not mean it counts as a Haven for any other purposes. If a card says it can be played as a resource, that does not mean it counts as a resource at any time except when it is being played. Remember: If it isn't there, it isn't there.

The second thing to remember is check all possible factors. In order to save space, the rulings are not duplicated or cross referenced in the various relevant sections. Be sure to check the rules, rules annotations, card texts, and card errata first; and then check all relevant phase rulings, term rulings, and card rulings. And if you are in a tournament be sure to check those rulings also.

These are clarifications to the rules for the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_, except where noted as errata. Unless otherwise stated, they assume you are playing the one-deck standard game.

This rulings file will be updated every now and then. Items marked in blue with an @ are either new, changed, or certified full of assistant editor infestations for the latest update.

## II. Turn Sequence Rulings

### A. Beginning of the Game

If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in the starting company, then it does not count against the 10 character limit.

Either draw numbers for the whole game or roll dice for the whole game.

### B. Untap Phase

Corruption checks triggered at the end of this phase happen after everyone untaps.

### C. Organization Phase

#### Choosing a New Site

Rules Erratum: When a company splits any of the resulting companies can move with region movement. Region movement is not limited to one company of a split.

Any single site path cannot have more than one copy of a particular region.

Any company may declare as its new site a site already on the table. That site will remain on the table at least until the end of that company's movement/hazard phase.

Two companies may not start at the same site and move to the same new site.

@ Effects that are played during the organization phase, and depend on the site or site path of a moving company, create an effect which is not declared until the new site is revealed. If the site or site path is not of the appropriate type when the effect resolves, the resource has no effect.

#### Followers

A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence against "Blue Mountain Dwarves" to control characters with the home site Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold.

Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only once, not for each character.

#### Organizing Companies

If a company splits up, their player chooses which characters are the original company and which characters are a new company, unless otherwise directed by a card. All resource permanent-events played on the original company stay with the original company.

Company composition changes, including bringing a character into play, must all be done at the same time during the organization phase. During this time no other actions may be taken.

#### Playing Characters

Rules Erratum: You may play a character if you do not have enough influence to control them. However, if there are any characters you do not have the influence to control at the end of your organization phase, the character you brought into play this turn must be returned to your hand.

#### Storing Items

Minions who roll equal to or one less than their accumulated corruption when storing an item are only tapped.

### D. Long Event Phase

### E. Movement/Hazard Phase

#### General

Annotation 25: A company is considered to be at the site given by its site card at all times except from the moment their new site card is revealed during their movement/hazard phase until their old site card is discarded during the same movement/hazard phase. During this period a company is considered to be en route between sites and not at any site.

Annotation 26: If at the start of a movement/hazard phase there are multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order they are applied, the player who is currently not taking his turn decides the order in which they are to be applied. Once this interpretation is established, all further actions are applied in the order they are resolved for the rest of the turn.

Once the effects of an environment card have been applied to a target during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again to that target during the current turn.

Resource cards cannot be played between the movement/hazard phases of two different companies.

You do not have to decide how many cards you want to draw before you start to draw them.

Companies at the same non-haven/non-darkhaven site must join at the end of all movement/hazard phases, before the site phase starts. Companies at the same haven/darkhaven site may join at this time.

If companies would join at the end of the movement/hazard phase such that the company composition rules are violated, one company of the hazard player's choice must return to its site of origin.

If two companies join at a site, cards affecting one of the companies now affect them both.

A company's movement/hazard phase is concluded when both players agree to reconcile their hand sizes. No actions may be taken until the site phase or until both players have drawn cards for the movement of a following company.

#### Combat

Side effects of losing a character are resolved immediately after the character is lost, before other characters resolve their strikes.

If an attack states all characters in a company face a strike, then effects which allow a character to face more than one strike have no effect against the attack. Similarly, effects that change the attack's number of strikes have no effect. As an exception, effects which reduce the number of strikes to a specific number do work.

#### The Strike Sequence

Annotation 16: When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is considered in his history to have been wounded and must face any special actions the wounding strike presented him.

Annotation 17: The only actions that may be declared during a strike sequence are those outlined in Annotation 18.

Annotation 18: When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike against a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by either player until the strike dice-roll is made are the following: play hazard cards that affect the strike, the attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications due to strikes in excess of the company's size, a target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not automatically tap, and the defending character may play resource cards that affect the strike. An action that has the condition that a target character tap, but which otherwise has an effect not outlined here, may not be declared at this point. This is true even if the recipient of the strike would be the target character tapping and thus receive -1 to his prowess.

Annotation 19: Following each successful strike or failed strike, a body check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However, if the strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by "William" may be required to discard his items), these special actions are resolved before the body check. The body check is the first declared action in a nested chain of effects that immediately follows the strike dice-roll and special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions may be declared in response to a body check, in the same chain of effects, but these are limited to those actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. E.g., Tookish Blood could not be declared in response to the body check caused by Giant Spiders wounding a Hobbit. No action may be declared in response to a special action resulting from a strike unless the special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a special action is generally considered synonymous with the strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be declared in response to it if the action directly affects the dice-roll.

Annotation 20: If more than one special action is to follow a strike, the defending player decides the order they are resolved.

Annotation 21: A successful strike against a character is synonymous with that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the playing surface is not a separate action from the successful strike.

Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general, wounded characters are not considered tapped.

Non-item prowess bonuses are applied in the order the player controlling the character decides.

#### Movement

If a company does not move it still has a movement/hazard phase. No cards are drawn for the company and the only hazards that can be played on the company are creatures that can be keyed to the company's site and events.

Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they look that way on some maps.

@ If a company moves twice in one turn, resources played during the organization phase, like Secret Passage, are reapplied to the company at the beginning of each of their movement/hazard phases.

#### Playing Hazards

Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an effect, and this counts against the hazard limit unless specified otherwise on the card.

Hazards may only be played on a company whose movement/hazard phase is being resolved. Long-events and permanent-events may effect more than one company even though they are only played "on" one company.

If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a region type, those region types do not have to be consecutive in the site path.

If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent plays a resource before the movement/hazard phase ends, you may then continue playing hazards, assuming you have not yet reached the hazard limit.

If a company is moving from a surface site to an Under-deeps site, hazards may not be played keyed to the region of the surface site.

Angmar Arises, In Darkness Bind Them, and Reaching Shadow may not be used to play creatures keyed to double shadow-lands.

#### Returning to Site of Origin

If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path immediately disappears.

An effect that returns a company to its site of origin may not be declared in the middle of an attack.

### F. Site Phase General

Items, factions and allies must be played during the site phase..

There is no one resource card per site phase rule

The site taps upon successful play of the resource that would tap it.

#### Company vs. Company Combat

The defender may take actions that affect the attack or any of the strikes. The attacker may only take actions that affect individual strikes.

True Fana and Sacrifice of Form cannot be used in company versus company combat.

#### Exploring A Site/Automatic-attacks

A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an automatic-attack, and this counts as facing the automatic-attack.

Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the normal automatic-attacks for the site. Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in the order listed and/or resolved.

Company composition and overt/covert status is checked before each automatic attack

@ Hazards have no effect on company vs. company combat.

#### Influence Attempts

It is not possible to influence an item away from a Wizard or Ringwraith.

You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.

A successful influence attempt on an opponent's resource does not tap the site.

#### On-Guard Cards

Rules Erratum: An on-guard may only be revealed if it could have also been played during the movement/hazard phase. This means all targets of the card must have existed during the movement/hazard phase in order for the card to be revealed.

A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as though it were both declared and resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects during which it was revealed.

An on-guard card my be revealed when the company plays resource that potentially taps the site. The card must affect the company or a character in the company that site phase. Note that this clarification is looser than the rule printed on p.61 of the Unlimited Rulesbook

A successful ring test does not allow an on-guard card to be revealed.

You may reveal a card in response to an influence attempt against a faction even if the on-guard card only has an effect if the attempt is successful. You may also reveal a card in response to such an attempt that affects the actual influence attempt.

Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be considered when determining the validity of revealing an on-guard card. Potential effects that have not been triggered cannot be considered.

A card cannot be revealed that returns a company to its site of origin.

A card cannot be revealed that taps a company's site.

A card cannot be revealed that potentially removes a character from a company.

A card cannot be revealed that forces a company to do nothing during its site phase.

A card that potentially removes an ally from the company can be revealed, so long as it otherwise is legal.

A card may not be revealed that taps a character in the company.

The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's hand.

@ When an on-guard card is revealed, it immediately ceases to be considered an on-guard card.

### G. End-of-Turn Phase

End-of-Turn effects are triggered by the ending of the End of Turn phase. Once both players are done with all actions in the End of Turn phase, all End of Turn effects are declared and resolved in the order chosen by the current player.

@ Cards may be played during the End-of-Turn phase after hand size has been reconciled.

### H. Free Council

You can be brought down to 0 points in a category due to negative marshalling points.

Characters may tap to aid corruption checks.

Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have an effect.

Only resources that directly affect corruption checks may be played during the Free Council.

## III. Rulings By Term

#### Actions

Tapping a resource can only be done at a time when you could otherwise play a resource event.

#### Active Conditions

An active condition must be in play or established when the action requiring it is declared. Active conditions serve as the price of an action. They are restrictions on the player invoking the action.

Annotation 5: If an action requires an entity to tap as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this point; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is cancelled.

Annotation 6: If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action.

Annotation 7: If any other active condition for an action does not exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action were playing a card from your hand, it is discarded.

Annotation 8: An action that requires a target is considered to have the active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared and when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects.

When a card mentions an alternate use, the active conditions given in the beginning of the card text need only be met if they are also mentioned by the alternate use.

Your opponent's resources may be the active conditions for your resources, but may not be the targets for your resources.

#### Agent

Rules Erratum: A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move from tapped status to untapped status).

Rules Erratum: An agent may tap to play creatures at a site if the company is moving to the site.

Playing a card that makes an agent attack is considered the attack's declaration.

Agents are not creatures.

Rolls made by agents during combat are done simultaneously with rolls made by characters during combat, after step 4 of the strike sequence.

Only face-up agents are considered for uniqueness.

While in play agents played as hazards may not become minion characters, and agents played as minion characters may not become hazards.

An agent played as a character in a Ringwraith deck can only be played at his home site.

When constructing a Ringwraith deck, agents are always considered characters.

To wound an agent you only need to defeat the prowess of one strike. To eliminate one you must defeat the prowess and body for all strikes.

Revealed agents may return to their homesite, even if they are at one of their homesites.

Cards played on an agent remain face up when the agent turns face down.

#### Ahunt Manifestations

If one Ahunt is out and you move through four of the regions listed on it, then you face the attack once.

#### Ally

Allies may tap to cancel attacks from Slayers and Assassins.

Allies cannot be targeted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot be taken prisoner.

Allies that may not be attacked by certain attacks may still tap to give +1 prowess to characters facing such attacks.

Playing an ally is not an influence attempt.

If an ally's controller leaves play for any reason, that ally is discarded.

@ Allies can be healed as if they were characters.

#### Attack

Annotation 12: An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded when the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final strike, and the associated body check are resolved.

Annotation 13: An attack may not be cancelled once its strikes have been assigned. A strike may not be cancelled once the dice-roll for the strike has been made.

Annotation 14: A cancelled attack has no effect on its target company, except that the company is considered in its history to have faced the attack.

Annotation 15: An attack must be the first declared action in a chain of effects, i.e., a creature card may not be played in response to another card in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception.

In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an attack, the character doing so must be in the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site type a hazard creature was keyed to can be affected otherwise.

Cards only modify attacks if they say they do.

When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the MPs, the creature goes to the out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played the attack.

Excess strikes applied as -1 modifiers do not have to have their body defeated

@ Any effect that would change the number of a strikes for an attack may not be played after strikes are assigned. This includes cards that have other additional effects, and cards that only indirectly change the number of strikes.

#### Burglary Attempts

After a successful burglary attempt, another character may tap to play a minor item.

The character who fails the burglary roll must face the automatic-attack as though he were a one-character company. He can receive no combat support other than what he himself can provide.

On-guard creatures are faced after a Burglaring attempt regardless of the success of the attempt.

#### Body Check

Annotation 22: When a character fails a body check, his items may be immediately reassigned to unwounded character in his company. Reassigning of the eliminated character's items is considered to be synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are discarded.

Effects that modify a character's body also modify the number an Orc or Troll would be discarded on. A maximum to body applies equally to the discard number.

If an Orc or Troll could be discarded and eliminated by a result, discard them instead of eliminating them.

@ "Affecting the body check" includes modifying the die roll or the body of the character making the check.

#### Cannot be Duplicated

Short-events that cannot be duplicated cannot be played if a card of the same name is currently having an effect on play.

Annotation 11 (modified from its original version): Some cards cannot be duplicated in limited cases -- generally on a specific target. Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated can be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being targeted by an effect that will discard it.

#### Card Effect Limitations

You may not play the following cards if your opponent is a Ringwraith or Sauron. Additionally, if you are not a Ringwraith or Sauron, a Ringwraith or Sauron opponent can play these cards against you and not be affected by any of their global effects.

 - All hazard events that require an agent\*
 - Bane of the Ithil-stone
 - The Black Enemy's Wrath
 - Foul Fumes
 - In the Heart of His Realm
 - Mordor in Arms
 - Mûmak
 - Worn and Famished

@ \*Near to Hear a Whisper and Sudden Fury from Middle-earth: Against the Shadow and Great Need or Purpose may be played because they do not target a specific agent.

The following cards are also listed in the MELE Rulesbook as having no effect on a Ringwraith/Sauron player, but this interpretation has been modified.

Chance of Being Lost and Winds of Wrath: You may play these cards against any opponent who is using the same type of location deck (hero sites or minion sites) as yourself.

Great Secrets Buried There: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or Sauron player one month after the release of Middle-earth: Against the Shadow.

The Nazgûl are Abroad: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or Sauron player. The only restriction is that the first two paragraphs are ignored when you play Nazgûl creatures against a Ringwraith or Sauron opponent. Any player can recycle Nazgûl hazards as stated on the card.

#### Character

A character enacting an effect counts as a character in his company.

A character in play must always be in one of three independent states: untapped, tapped, or wounded.

@ You can have three of a non-unique character in your deck.

#### Company

If all characters in a company are removed from the company, all resource permanent-events played on the company as a whole are discarded.

@ If all characters in a company leave play, the site goes to the location deck or discard pile, depending on its tapped status. If this happens during the movement/hazard phase, the site card stays in play until the end of all movement/hazard phases. In this case, on-guard cards may still be played on the site.

@ The following allies make a company overt: The Balrog, Creature of an Older World, Great Bats, Great Lord of Goblin-gate, Last Child of Ungoliant, Regiment of Black Crows, and Two-headed Troll.

#### Corruption

Annotation 23: When a character fails a corruption check, the standard effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or eliminated and his items being discarded) are implemented immediately and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g. The Precious), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., Traitor, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive condition of a failed check, take effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check.

@ Characters with 0 corruption points must still make corruption checks.

A character may attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping. The roll is at -3. A corruption card may only be attempted to be removed once per turn if the tapping requirement is ignored.

You can not attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping if you have attempted to remove that card already this turn.

The resolution of a character tapping to give +1 to a corruption check happens when the corruption check itself resolves.

If an effect is in play that prevents a character from being discarded, the character is not considered to fail his corruption check if a result is achieved that would discard him. A Wizard would not be eliminated and his player would not lose the game.

#### Darkhaven

Whenever an effect targeting a hero refers to Darkhavens, interpret it as referring to Havens instead.

@ Attacks at Darkhavens are canceled only if the company is at the Darkhaven.

#### Detainment Attacks

When a strike from a detainment attack succeeds, the character who was facing that particular strike must tap.

Detainment attacks that would force item discards normally do not force discards while they are detainment attacks.

#### Discard

A discarded character may be brought into play again by any player.

When a card is discarded, so are all permanent-events on that card.

Cards discarded from a player's hand must be discarded one at a time as separate actions.

Whenever a character is discarded, all non-follower cards played with that character are also discarded.

#### Eliminated

When a card is eliminated, all permanent-events on that card are discarded.

#### Exhausted

Permanent-events discarded when the play deck is exhausted are shuffled into the new play deck along with the rest of the discard pile.

#### Gold Ring Item

When a gold ring item is tested, the ring is discarded and its marshalling points are lost whether or not you are able to play a special item.

Ring special items played as a result of storing a ring at a Dark Haven will come into play stored.

@ Special items, played after a ring test from storing a gold ring item, come into play stored.

#### Hand Size

Effects which increase your hand size or allow you to hold one more card in your hand mean you draw up to your new hand size or discard down to it at the appropriate points during the game.

#### Haven

Havens can tap.

Whenever an effect targeting a minion refers to a Haven, interpret as a Darkhaven instead.

#### Hobbits

If a Hobbit is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be brought back into play normally at Bag End.

#### Influence

Restricted direct influence is limited in its use, usually to characters and/or factions of specific races. Unrestricted direct influence has no restrictions on its use.

When a character suffers a minus to direct influence, it must come from unrestricted direct influence first. If there is no unrestricted influence and there are multiple instances of restricted direct influence, the player may choose which restricted direct influence the minus is applied to.

If a card reduces direct influence, making it illegal for a follower to be controlled, the follower does need to be controlled until their next organization phase.

A character removed from the control of direct influence outside the organization phase does not need to be controlled by general influence until their next organization phase.

#### Items

The "free" minor item may only be played immediately after playing the resource that taps that site.

#### Marshalling Point Pile

Under standard rules, no more than half of your marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling point. Do not round up.

You may not target hazards in your opponent's marshalling point pile for removal.

#### May not Untap

Nothing may untap a character who is the subject of an effect that states the character may not untap.

#### MELE vs. METW

Hero items may not be used as conditions for minion resources, and minion items may not be used as conditions for hero resources.

If you are playing against a deck with three Wizards in it, you may play any combination of three Ringwraiths, except one each of three different Ringwraiths.

Hero characters may now cancel automatic-attacks at their homesite, regardless of their opponent.

You may not have both the minion and hero version of a unique item in your deck.

#### Minion characters

Minion characters are not affected by cards that target agents.

#### Multi-player Games

Only the player to the left of the moving player may take advantage of drawing cards, including cards drawn for events like The Nazgul are Abroad and From the Pits of Angbad.

All players reset their hand size when any turn or movement/hazard phase ends.

In multi-player games the following hazards count as 1/2 a creature: hazards that can be played as events or creatures, Ahunt Dragon manifestations, and At Home Dragon manifestations. Agents in a Wizard deck also count as 1/2 creatures.

You may only play The Lidless Eye if none of your opponents are Ringwraiths.

Twilight may only be played by the moving player and the hazard player. As an exception, a player who's own environment will be discarded by an environment may play Twilight to cancel that environment.

@ For Spying out the Land and Here is a Snake, each hazard player shows hazards immediately before he draws and/or plays hazards, and then can only play those hazards. Players who are not playing hazards are not required to show hazards.

#### Normal

@ Normal means as written on the card, not considering other card's effects.

#### Nazgûl

If a Nazgûl is tapped to become a short-event as printed on its card, it turns into a short-event upon declaration. At this point, the Nazgul is a short-event just as if had been played as such from your hand.

The body referred to in the text of female characters with combat bonuses against Nazgûl is the body of the Nazgûl

#### Optional Rules

If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the character, the second strike is considered successful.

A character tapping to face two strikes is at -3 prowess against both strikes. The character taps when resolving the second strike.

For recently visited sites in multi-player games, the automatic-attack gets +1 for each player who has that site in their discard pile.

#### Passive Conditions

A passive condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already in play.

Annotation 9: If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action is cancelled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules.

Annotation 10: If more than one action is required to be the first action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions have been declared.

A card causing an action as a result of a passive condition must be in play when the action resolves, or else the action is cancelled.

When something would be discarded by a passive condition, that discard is considered simultaneous with the resolution of the passive condition.

#### Reveal

@ Any revealed cards are shown to all players.

#### Ringwraiths

You may have any number of Ringwraiths in your sideboard, as long as you do not duplicate more than one of them in the combined deck and sideboard.

Characters with combat bonuses against Nazgul also get those bonuses against Ringwraiths.

#### Ringwraith Followers

Ringwraith followers may still use magic as printed on their card.

#### Sage Only

Any card requiring a sage to play is a sage only card.

#### Short-event

Short-events are discarded when resolved in a chain of effects, not when declared. Thus, they can be targeted by certain special effects in the chain of effects.

#### Sideboard

The sideboard is increased to 25 cards.

You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent's Wizard is in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent's untap phase and then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgûl permanent-event to do so. The hazard limit against all of your opponent's companies that turn is halved, rounded up.

Tapping a Nazgûl to bring cards in from the sideboard does not turn the Nazgûl into a short-event.

#### Site

To untap a site the character doing so must be at that site.

#### Site Path

Certain cards refer to the site's site path. The site's site path is always the site path given on the site card, regardless of how the company got to that site.

Events can alter both a site's site path and a company's site path.

#### Skill Cards

@ Two or more skill cards may be played by a single character outside of combat.

@ Two skill cards may not be declared by one character against a given strike.

#### Targets

An action that is played out through one or more specific entities as stated on a card or in the rules is considered to "target" the entities. A targeted entity is said to be a "target" of the action. A card that acts on a class of entities does not target them.

Annotation 1: A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g. a corruption check.

Annotation 2: A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared.

Annotation 3: Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they generally affect an entire class of things.

Annotation 4: An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-guard cards.

You cannot target an opponent's character or resources with your own resources.

#### Timing

The validity of an effect, including the hazard limit, is checked upon declaration and upon resolution.

Annotation 24: If a card specifies that more than one action occur when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all of these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed.

(amendment to original version of Annotation 24): As an exception, if one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the strike sequence--see Annotation 18.

Annotation 27: If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for the choice of effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discarded. The player may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect of the card.

#### Trophies

Creatures whose marshalling points are listed with an * give marshalling points when used as trophies.

Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies.

Trophies can be discarded to satisfy thief creatures.

#### Under-deeps

Marshalling points with companies at an Under-deeps site do not count only for the purposes of calling the Free Council. They do count at the actual Council itself.

When a company's site of origin is an Under-deeps site and the company reveals a new site at the start of its movement/hazard phase, the company is declaring it will make a roll to determine if the movement was successful. No cards can be played between the site being revealed and the roll except for Reach of Ulmo.

At an Under-deeps site, after a successful rescue attempt, a character can tap for a minor item only.

@ Automatic-attacks that allow the revealing of creature cards are not stopped by Stealth or Secret Entrance.

#### Wizard

You may put two of the same Wizard in your deck, or you may put one copy each of two different Wizards in your deck.

## IV. Tournament Rulings

Tournament rulings are modifications and additions to the rules presented in the Unlimited Edition rulesbook that are required for sanctioned Council of Lórien tournament play.

#### General

Dice must be used to obtain random numbers.

There is a required 30 card minimum for both resources and hazards for sanctioned tournament play.

Up to 3 copies of one Wizard or Ringwraith is allowed in a play deck, or up to 2 copies of one and 1 copy of another . One copy each of three different Wizards or Ringwraiths is not allowed.

@ All Ringwraith/Sauron players always have +5 unused general influence at all times. This bonus general influence can never be used to control characters.

#### Deck Construction

Cards that can be played as either hazards or resources may count as either for purposes of deck construction.

Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.

The following count as 1/2 a creature for deck construction: hazards that can be played as creatures or events, At Home Dragon manifestations, Ahunt Dragon manifestations and agents. Note that agents count as characters in Ringwraith decks, not as 1/2 creatures.

@ You may play with three Ringwraiths in your play deck, as long as they are not three different Ringwraiths.

@ You may place Ringwraiths or Wizards in your sideboard, as long as only one of them is duplicated in the deck and sideboard combined, and you have only Ringwraiths or only Wizards in the deck and sideboard combined.

#### The Character Draft

The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.

Each player reveals one character at a time from their pool, simultaneously with their opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into the starting parties, duplicated characters are put aside and not allowed in either starting company. Each player continues until they want to stop, they have 20 points of mind in their starting company, or they have five characters in their starting company.

Ringwraith players may start with 6 characters in the character draft

If one player stops revealing characters, the other one may continue to play characters.

No player may reveal a character that would bring his starting company's total mind over 20.

When players are finished, each may put up to 10 characters into their deck, including characters from his starting pool that did not end up in the starting company.

#### Great Secrets Buried There

If you play this card as a hazard on your opponent, you must be able to provide your opponent with a copy of any uncommon Under-deeps sites if he does not have a copy in his location deck.

@ If you give an Under-deeps site to your opponent, it will return to your location deck when they are done with it, unless you have also used the site, in which case it returns to your discard pile.

#### Movement

Maps of the regions of MECCG may be used in place of region cards in Council of Lórien tournaments. If two companies move on the same turn, then the second company does not have to determine the site path to its new site until the beginning of it's movement/hazard phase.

@ Wizard companies cannot use starter movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth. If using region movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth, they must move from a site in Imlad Morgul, through either Nurn or Udun, or use a movement enhancer like Ash Mountains or Eagle-mounts. Such sites may be reached normally with Under-deeps movement.

#### Starting Companies

@ Ringwraith/Sauron players may have starting companies at Dol Guldur and/or Minas Morgul. A Ringwraith may also be brought into play at Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul, or his home site.

#### The Weakest Link Method

If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption point to each non-Wizard in play. Each character then makes a corruption check and marshalling points are recounted.

Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all non-Wizard characters are corrupted away.
