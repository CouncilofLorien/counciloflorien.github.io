# Middle Earth: The Wizards

{: .text-center .text-beta }
Official Rulings

Version 2 current as of 01-09-97
{: .text-center }

The _MECCG_ Collected Official Ruling File has taken the place of the official FAQ.

Around the first of every month, this rulings file will be updated. Items marked with a –=– are either new, changed, or certified free of Dragon infestations for the latest update.

The Annotations from the _Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion_ have now been integrated into the rulings. They are denoted as annotations and retain their original numbering as given in the Companion. Note that Annotations 11 and 24 have been modified from what is printed in the Companion.

If playing in a tournament, be sure to check the tournament rulings, as some of them differ from the rulings for casual play.

## I. TURN SEQUENCE

### Begining of the Game

If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in the starting company, then it does not count against the 10 character limit. Note, when playing in a Council of Lorien sanctioned tournament, and, thus, using the Character Draft, duplicated starting characters do count against the 10 character limit.

Either draw numbers for the whole game or roll dice for the whole game. Note that players must roll dice in Council of Lórien sanctioned tournaments.

### A. Untap Phase
Corruption checks triggered at the end of this phase happen after everyone untaps. Characters that tap to aid the check will not untap until their next untap phase.
You may do things besides untap during this phase.

### B. Organization Phase

#### Followers

A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence against "Blue Mountain Dwarves" to control characters with the home site Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold.

Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only once, not for each character.

#### Playing Characters

You may play a character if you do not have enough influence to control them. However, if there are any characters you cannot control at the end of your organization phase they will be discarded.

–=– \[This is a modification to an existing ruling.] You may play a character if you do not have enough influence to control them. However, if there are any characters you do not have the influence to control at the end of your organization phase, the character you brought into play this turn must be returned to your hand.–=–

You may play a character under general influence at their home site without a company at that site. The one exception to this is if you are playing Standard Game and your Wizard has been revealed. In that case your Wizard must be present to bring a character into play under general influence.

Hobbits may only be brought into play at Bag End, not at Havens.

#### Region Cards

–=– (clarification) Region cards are not unique. However, any single site path cannot have more than one copy of a particular region card. With the acceptable (and preferred) method of moving using a map and not actual region cards, this rule translates into a company cannot backtrack. –=–
 
#### Splitting Companies

–=– (errata) This is big, a company can split, and any of the resulting companies can move with region movement. Region movement is no longer limited to one company of a split. This is errata to the rules about a company splitting.–=– 

### C. Long Event Phase

### D. Movement/Hazard Phase

#### General

A company is not considered to be at the site of destination (i.e., its new site) until the end of the company's movement/hazard phase and the site of origin is removed. A company is only considered to be moving during its movement/hazard phase, and only if it plays a new site card.

Resource cards cannot be played between the movement/hazard phases of two different companies.

You do not have to decide how many cards you want to draw before you start to draw them.

#### Combat

Strikes are assigned in the following manner: First the defending player assigns strikes to his untapped characters; Second the attacking player assigns the remaining strikes; Third the attacking player may assign extra strikes as -1 modifiers to characters' prowess. Each character must be assigned one strike before any character gets an extra strike. The extra strikes need not be assigned to a character until that character's strike is resolved.

An attack may be canceled at any time up until the strikes are assigned. A strike may be canceled at any time up until the dice are rolled.

Cancelling a strike does not defeat it.

A creature cannot be canceled based on region type if that creature was played keyed to a region by name.

Side effects of losing a character are resolved immediately after the character is lost, before other characters resolve their strikes.

Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general, wounded charcters are not considered tapped.

If a creature has a body, each strike is only defeated if the body is defeated for that strike.

Prowess modifications from items come first. Then other bonuses are applied in the order the player controlling the character decides. Even a bonus given on a character's card is applied after item bonuses.

–=– If an attack states all characters in a company face a strike, then effects which allow a character to face more than one strike have no effect against the attack. Similarly, effects that increase the attack's number of strikes have no effect. –=–

#### Company

–=– At the end of his movement/hazard phase, if a player has multiple companies at the same site, these companies must join into one company. If the resulting company has a size greater than seven, they must still join, and then be split into multiple companies (or otherwise resolved) during the player's following organization phase. –=–

#### Movement

Starter movement works as follows: Each company will have a face up site card showing the site it is at. This is called the site of origin. By the end of the organization phase put a face down new site for each of your companies that wishes to move. If a company's site of origin is a non-haven site (not Rivendell, Lorien, Edhellond, or Grey Havens), the new site must be the nearest haven. If the site of origin is a haven site there are two options. If you want to go to another haven you may go to one of the two nearest havens listed on your site of origin card, the new site card would be one of these two havens. If you want to go to a non-haven site it must be one which lists the site of origin as the nearest haven. If the company successfully makes it to the new site, discard the site of origin at the end of that company's movement/hazard phase.

Region movement works as follows: To move a company from its site of origin to another site using region movement, lay down a series of up to four regions and the new site by the end of your organization phase. Each region in the series must list on its card the regions that are connected with it in the series as adjacent regions. The region at the beginning of the series must be the region listed on the site of origin card. The region at the end of the series must be the region listed on the new site card. A site which lies more than four regions away from the site of origin may not be reached in one turn with region movement (without Bridge, Shadowfax, etc.).

Region movement can be used to move from one non-Haven site to another non-Haven site.

A company does not have to move each turn. If a company does not move it still has a movement/hazard phase. No cards are drawn for the company and the only hazards that can be played on the company are creatures that can be keyed to the company's site and events.

Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they look that way in the rule book.

–=– A company's movement/hazard phase is concluded when both players agree to reconcile (discard down to/draw up to) their hand sizes. No resources (and obviously no hazards) can be played--and no resource effects can be activated--until the site phase or until both players have drawn cards for the movement of a following company. –=–

#### Playing Hazards

The hazard limit does not change if a character is eliminated or discarded during the movement/hazard phase.

Hazard permanent-events count against the hazard limit. Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an effect, and this counts against the hazard limit unless specified otherwise on the card.

Hazards may only be played on a company whose movement/hazard phase is being resolved. Long-events and permanent-events may effect more than one company even though they are only played "on" one company.

If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a region type, those region types do not have to be consecutive in the site path.

If a creature hazard resolves and there are no longer any instances of the region or site it was keyed to, then the creature is immediately discarded for no effect on play. If any instances of the region or site it was keyed to are in the site path when the creature resolves, the creature take effect (even if those instances were not there when the creature was declared).

If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent plays a resource before the movement/hazard phase ends, you may then continue playing hazards (assuming you have not yet reached the hazard limit).

A creature that be played in a specific region (i.e., "Playable in Cardolan") can be played on a company using starter movement if that company's site of origin or site of destination is in that specific region.

#### Returning to Site of Origin

–=– If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path immediately disappears. Corruption checks would not be triggered on Lure of Nature if its bearer's company returns to its site of origin. –=–

–=– Any effect that returns a company to its site of origin may not be declared in the middle of an attack. –=–

### E. Site Phase

–=– The Golden Rule: in order to play any card during the site phase (or take any action with the company in question), the site must be entered. This means facing any automatic-attacks, even if you have entered the site on a previous turn. –=–

–=– The Golden Rule, Part II: Besides all those resources which the rules state must be played during the site phase (items, factions, allies), a resource does not have to be played during the site phase unless the card says so. You can play Fate of the Ithil-stone during the organization phase, for example. You can test a ring during the end-of-turn phase, for example. –=–

–=– The Golden Rule, Part III: There is no one item/ally/faction/information card per site phase rule. The only requirements to playing such a resource is that the site be untapped and that you faced any automatic-attacks at the start of the site phase. Of course, playing such a resource taps the site, and imposes an effective one site-tapping resouce per turn rule without enhancement. –=–

#### Exploring A Site/Automatic-attacks

To explore a site, first declare you are exploring the site. Then face any automatic-attacks at the site and any on-guard hazard creatures revealed. Then, if you have any untapped characters, you may tap one to play an item, information, ally, or faction card. For most items and information cards the site will say if they are playable at that site. Some items, and factions and allies, say on the resource card at which sites they are playable.

A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an automatic-attack, and this counts as facing the automatic-attack.
The automatic-attack is not a hazard.

You must face the automatic-attack on the turn you attempt to play any resource during the site phase (or enact any resource effect), even if you faced that attack on a previous turn.

Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the normal automatic-attacks for the site. Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in the order listed and resolved.

#### Influence Attempts

It is not possible to influence an item away from a Wizard.

If an influence attempt against a character is succesful, then any allies they control are discarded.

You must enter a site to make an influence attempt.

You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.

#### On-Guard Cards

An often confusing point is when and if certain hazards can be revealed as on-guard cards. There are two cases when a face down card may be revealed, and, thusly, affect an opponent's company: 1) when the company announces it will face a site's automatic-attacks (before the automatic-attack is itself faced), and 2) when the company plays a card keyed to the site.

For case #1, it is essential to realize that if the site has no automatic-attacks (like all normally occuring Free-holds), you cannot reveal an on-guard card according to this criterium. Additionally, an event that modifies the prowess of a character may not be revealed--only hazards that modify an automatic-attack itself can be. A creature revealed as an on-guard card is not considered an automatic-attack--it is considered a hazard creature attack.

For case #2, specifically, you may reveal an on-guard card in the same chain of effects in response to the play (declaration thereof) of any item, faction, ally, or other card that potentially taps the site. Successfully testing for and playing a ring special item does not count! You may reveal an on-guard card in response to the declaration of an influence attempt on a faction that only has an effect if the attempt would be successful (e.g., Lure of Power). Also, in the case of a faction, you may reveal an on-guard card that affects the actual influence attempt.

Additionally, the on-guard card may only be revealed if it affects the company or a character in the company that site phase--this clarification is actually looser than the rule printed on page page 61 of the METW Unlimited Rulesbook. This rule did state the on-guard card may only be revealed if it directly affected the company. Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be considered when determining the validy of revealing an on-guard card--cards in your hand, your opponent's hand, play deck, discard pile, etc. cannot be considered and potential effects that have not been triggered cannot be considered. An on-guard card may not be revealed if it has an effect that is meaningless during a company's site phase.

As an example of how this requirement is looser now, Balance of Things may be revealed as an on-guard card so long as at least one character in the company, during whose site phase Balance of Things is revealed, carries at least one corruption source.

_Balrog of Moria_ could be revealed when a company chooses to face the automatic-attacks at Moria (_Balrog_ modifies Moria's automatic-attacks). However, it could not be revealed in response to the play of an item at Moria because Balrog in no way can affect the company for the rest of the site phase (unless for some reason the company is fated to face the automatic-attacks again).

A corruption card can be revealed as an on-guard card (so long as it otherwise is legal)--because a character in the company is affected. A card that changes the company's site type cannot be revealed unless this has some obvious effect on the company that site phase.

 1. A card cannot be revealed that returns a company to its site of origin.
 2. A card cannot be revealed that taps a company's site.
 3. A card cannot be revealed that potentially removes a character from a company.
 4. A card cannot be revealed that forces a company to do nothing during its site phase.
 5. A card that potentially removes an ally from the company can be revealed (so long as it otherwise is legal).
 6. _Traitor_ cannot be revealed.
 7. _Troll-purse_ (from _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_) can be revealed.

The spirit of the on-guard card is to represent a hazard threat that existed during a company's movement/hazard phase, but of which the company was not aware. The actual rule that portrays this spirit is: an on-guard may only be revealed if it could have also been played during the movement/hazard phase--this is a slight modification from the rule printed on page page 61 of the METW Unlimited Rulesbook. Practically, this means all targets of the card must have existed during the movement/hazard phase in order for the card to be revealed.

IMPORTANT: A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as though it were both declared and resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects during which it was revealed. For example, if a Greed is played in reponse to the play of an item, it is considered to be in effect immediately prior to the play of item. Thus, Greed would cause corruption checks following the play of the item.

As a final, encompassing example, Muster Disperses cannot be revealed as an on-guard card for three reasons.

 1. Muster Disperses cannot target a faction played during the site phase during which it would be revealed because this target did not exist during the movement/hazard phase.
 2. Muster Disperses cannot target a faction already in play at the start of the site phase because it would not affect a company or a character in the company.
 3. Muster Disperses cannot target a faction played during the site phase during which it would be revealed because this target does not exist when Muster Disperses would be revealed. A card can only be revealed in the same chain of effects as the play of a resource that potentially taps the site, and this resource actually is not resolved and cannot be targetted at that point.

Some long- and permanent-events (like Awaken Denizens) can be revealed on-guard and effect multiple companies. These cards specify that they affect "each" or "all" sites of a certain type.

Creatures cannot be revealed on-guard at a site with no automatic-attack. They can be played on-guard at such sites, but will return to your hand at the end of the site phase.

You may play two on-guard hazards on the same site if two companies are moving to the same site.

The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's hand.

#### Playing Allies

You do not need to spend influence (direct or general) to control an ally.

Allies cannot be passed from one player to another.

#### Playing Factions

The site does not tap unless the faction is succesfully played.

#### Playing Items

You may play two weapons, shields, or armors on the same character but only one of each may have an effect on the character.

You may play a minor item after succesfully playing a resource that taps the site even if minor items are not playable at that site.

The "free" minor item may only be played immediately after playing the resource that taps that site.

### F. End-of-Turn Phase

Resources may be played after you reconcile your hand.

### G. Free Council

If you have 0 marshalling points in characters, items, factions, or allies then your opponents points for that type are doubled \[standard game]. This includes if you are brought down to 0 points in a category due to negative marshalling points.

Characters may tap to aid corruption checks. Note that the player calling the Free Council does not get an untap phase before it.

Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have an effect.

Resources may be played during the Free Council.

## II. Rulings By Term

#### Actions/Active and Passive Conditions

An active condition must be in play or established when the action requiring it is declared. Typical active conditions are tapping a card and discarding a card. For example, Magic Ring of Stealth can cancel a strike against its bearer if two particular active conditions are met: The bearer must be a scout and Magic Ring of Stealth must tap. These are called active conditions because a player actively decides to invoke the action they satisfy. Active conditions serve as the price of an action. They are restrictions to the player invoking the action. In the case of Magic Ring of Stealth, the player cancelling the strike must have provided a scout and he must tap the ring, which renders the ring unable to be used again until his next turn.

Annotation 5: If an action requires an entitiy to tap as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this point; this is considered synonymous with the action's declarartion, i.e., it is not a seperate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is cancelled.

Annotation 6: If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a seperate action.

Annotation 7: If any other active condition for an action does not exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action were playing a card from your hand, it is discarded.

Annotation 8: An action that requires a target is considered to have the active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared and when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects.

A passive condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already in play. Typical passive conditions involve forcing corruption checks and forcing the effects of environmental long-events. These are called passive conditions because the actions they satisfy come into play only indirectly as the result of a decision made by a player.

Annotation 9: If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action is cancelled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules.

Annotation 10: If more than one action is required to be the first action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions have been declared.

–=– NEW RULING: A long or permanent-event (or other card) causing an action as a result of a passive condition must be in play when the action resolves, or else the action is cancelled. For example, you can play Twilight to discard Long Winter before the effect of Long Winter causes your new site to tap. This cancels this effect of Long Winter. –=–

#### Ahunt Manifestations

If one Ahunt is out and you move through four of the regions listed on it, then you face the attack once.

If four Ahunts are out an you move through one region listed on all four, then you face each of the four attacks once.

–=– Ahunt manifestations of unique Dragons are not considered creatures for cards that affect the playing of a creature hazards, since Ahunt manifestations are not played as creatures. An attack caused by an Ahunt manifestation is considered from a hazard creature for cards that affect hazard creatures already in play. –=–

#### Ally

An ally can play any non-item resource that requires a specific skill.

Allies cannot bear items.

Allies cannot tap to support corruption checks.

Allies may tap to cancel attacks from Slayers and Assassins.

Allies never make corruption checks.

–=– Ent allies can be attack by rescue attacks. –=–

–=– Allies cannot be targetted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot be taken prisoner. –=–

#### Attack

Cancelling an attack will not defeat it. The company will not have to face the attack, but neither will they get marshalling points for it.

In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an attack, the character doing so must be in the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site type a hazard creature is keyed to (when declared) can be affected otherwise.

Annotation 12: An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded when the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final strike, and the associated body check are resolved.

Annotation 13: An attack may not be cancelled once its strikes have been assigned. A strike may not be cancelled once the dice-roll for the strike has been made.

Annotation 14: A cancelled attack has no effect on its target company, except that the company is considered in its history to have faced the attack.

Annotation 15: An attack must be the first declared action in a chain of effects, i.e., a creatue card may not be played in response to another card in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception.

Annotation 16: When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is considered in his history to have been wounded and must face any special actions the wounding strike presented him.

#### Cannot be Duplicated

Short-events that cannot be duplicated cannot be played if a card of the same name is currently having an effect on play.

A long- or permanent-events that cannot be duplicated can be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being targetted by an effect that will discard it.

Annotation 11 (modified from its original version):Some cards cannot be duplicated in limited cases--generally on a specific target. Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated can be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being targetted by an effect that will discard it.

#### Character

You may continue to play after you have lost all of your characters.

A character enacting an effect counts as a character in his/her company.

A character in play must always be in one of three independent states: untapped, tapped, or wounded.

#### Company

If a company splits up, their player chooses which characters are the original company and which characters are a new company (unless otherwise directed by a card). All resource permanent-events played on the original company stay with the original company. This rule will mostly come into play with the release of Middle-earth: Dark Minions.

If all characters in a company are removed from the company (i.e., all characters have been explictly removed from the original company), all resource permanent-events played on the company as a whole are discarded. This rule will mostly come into play with the release of Middle-earth: Dark Minions.

Annotation 25: A company is considered to be at the site given by its site card at all times except from the moment their new site card is revealed during their movement/hazard phase until their old site card is discarded during the same movement/hazard phase. During this period a company is considered to be en route between sites and not at any site.

#### Corruption

Characters with 0 corruption points must still make corruption checks.

A character may attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping (ignoring the tapping requirement). The roll is at -3. A corruption card may only be attemtped to be removed once per turn if the tapping requirement is ignored.

#### Corruption Checks

Annotation 23: When a character fails a corruption check, the standard effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or eliminated and his items being discarded) are implemented immediately and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g. The Precious), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., Traitor, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive condition of a failed check, take effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check.

–=– The resolution of a character tapping to give +1 to a corruption check happens when the corruption check itself resolves, not in the normal "last in, first out" order. –=–

–=– If an effect is in play that prevents a character from being discarded (e.g., Magical Harp, Tookish Blood), the character is not considered to fail his corruption check if a result is achieved that would discard him. A Wizard would not be eliminated and his player would not lose the game. –=–

#### Discard

A discarded character may be brought into play again by any player.

#### Dunadan

Dunadan do not count as Men.

#### Eliminated

An eliminated character may not be played by any player for the rest of the game.

#### Environment Cards

Once the effects of an environment card have been applied again during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again during the current turn. If several environment cards are in effect at the beginning of a movement/hazard phase, the non-phasing player chooses the order in which the effects of those cards are applied. This choice is made after the moving player has revealed the first movement declaration where the order of application would be a consideration.

#### Events targetting sites

–=– Events that target sites can only target sites in play used to show a company's location or movement. –=–

#### Gold Ring Item

When a gold ring item is tested, the ring is discarded and the marshalling points are lost whether or not you are able to play a special item.

#### Hand Size

–=– Effects which increase your hand size mean you draw up to your new hand size or discard down to it at the appropriate points during the game. This supercedes the normal requirement of drawing up to or discarding down to 8 cards. Note that Favor of the Valar requires you to draw 8 cards, not to your hand size. –=–

#### Haven

Havens can tap, but Havens are always returned to the location deck and not the discard pile.

#### Hobbits

Hobbit characters may only be brought into play at havens if it is the start of the game and they are your starting characters. If a Hobbit is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be normally brought back into play at Bag End.

#### Influence

–=– A successful influence attempt on an opponent's item does not tap the site. –=–

#### Nazgûl

–=– If a Nazgûl is tapped to become a short-event as printed on its card, it turns into a short-event upon declaration. At this point, the Nazgul is a short-event just as if had been played as such from your hand. –=–

#### Short-event

–=– Short-events are discarded when resolved in a chain of effects, not when declared. Thus, they can be targetted by certain special effects in the chain of effects (like Searching Eye). –=–

#### Sideboard

The sideboard is increased to 20 cards with the release of Middle-earth: The Dragons (in Spring 1996).

You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent's Wizard is in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent's untap phase and then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgul permament-event to do so. The hazard limit against all of your opponent's companies that turn is halved, rounded up.

–=– Tapping a Nazgul to bring cards in from the sideboard does not turn the Nazgul into a short-event. The Nazgul permanent-event is discarded upon declaration of this effect as per Annotation 6. –=–

#### Site

To untap a site the character doing so must be at that site.

#### Site Path

The site path depends on what sort of movement was used. If using starter movement between Havens the site path is given on the Haven card in the text box. If using starter movement to or from a non-Haven site the site path is given on the non-Haven site, along the left side of the card. If using region movement the site path is determined by the region cards played on the company. In all of the above cases the site path includes the site you are moving to.

Certain cards refer to the site's site path. The site's site path is always the site path given on the site card, regardless of how the company got to that site.

Events can alter both the site's site path and a company's site path.

#### Skill Cards

Two skill cards may be played at one time on the same character outside of combat.

#### Strike

A strike is only defeated if the body of the strike is defeated.

#### The Strike Sequence

The strike sequence is a period of time that begins when a player announces one of his characters will resolve a strike and ends after the strike dice-roll (or strike cancellation) and any body checks resulting from that strike.

Annotation 17: The only actions that may be declared during a strike sequence are those outlined in Annotation 18.

Annotation 18: When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike against a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by either player until the strike dice-roll is made are the following: play hazard cards that affect the strike, the attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications due to strikes in excess of the company's size, a target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not automatically tap, and the defending character may play resource cards that affect the strike. An action that has the condition that a target character tap, but which otherwise has an effect not outlined here, may not be declared at this point. This is true even if the recipient of the strike would be the target character tapping and thus recieve -1 to his prowess.

Annotation 19: Following each successful strike or failed strike, a body check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However, if the strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by "William" may be required to discard his items), these special actions are resolved before the body check. The body check is the first declared action in a nested chain of effects that immediately follows the strike dice-roll and special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions may be declared in response to a body check, in the same chain of effects, but these are limited to those actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. E.g., Tookish Blood could not be declared in response to the body check caused by Giant Spiders wounding a Hobbit. No action may be declared in response to a special action resulting from a strike unless the special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a special action is generally considered synonymous with the strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be declared in response to it if the action directly affects the dice-roll.

Annotation 20: If more than one special action is to follow a strike, the defending player decides the order they are resolved.

Annotation 21: A successful strike against a character is synonymous with that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the playing surface is not a seperate action from the successful strike.

Annotation 22: When a character fails a body check, his items may be immediately reassigned to unwounded character in his company. Reassigning of the eliminate character's items is considered to be synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are discarded.

#### Tap

Tapping a character does not tap that character's items.

A spell only taps a Wizard if the spell card says it does.

#### Targets

An action that is played out thrugh one or more specific entities as stated on a card or in the rules is considered to "target" the entities. A targeted entity is said to be a "target" of the action. Possible targets include characters, sites, companies, regions, items, factions, corruption checks, and combat dice rolls. A card that acts on a class of entities, however, does not target them (e.g., Foul Fumes).

Annotation 1: A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g. a corruption check.

Annotation 2: A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared.

Annotation 3: Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they generally affect an entire class of things.

Annotation 4: An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-guard cards.

–=– You cannot target an opponent's character, resouces, etc with your own resources. However, regarding the mere existence of a card in play as being the active condition for you playing another card (with all targets being otherwise legal), your opponent's cards work just as well as yours. –=–

#### Wizard

You may put two of the same Wizard in your deck, or you may put one copy each of two different Wizards in your deck. Please see Tournament Rulings below for the Council of Lórien modifications to this rule for sanctioned tournament play.

## III. Timing Rulings

The validity of an effect is checked upon declaration and upon resolution.

The effects of a card happen in the order listed on the card.

If a card has an alternate use the player playing the card chooses the use at declaration.

Annotation 24: If a card specifices that more than one action occur when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all of these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed.

(amendment to original version of Annotation 24): As an exception, if one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the strike sequence--see Annotation 18.

## IV. Miscellaneous Rulings

#### General Play

Annotation 26: If at the start of a movement/hazard phase there are multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order they are applied, the player who is currently not taking his turn decides the order in which they are to be applied. Once this interpretation is established, all further actions are applied in the order they are resolved for the rest of the turn.

Once the effects of an environment card have been applied again during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again during the current turn. If several environment cards are in effect at the beginning of a movement/hazard phase, the non-phasing player chooses the order in which the effects of those cards are applied. This choice is made after the moving player has revealed the first movement declaration where the order of application would be a consideration.

Annotation 27: If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for the choice of effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discarded. The player may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect of the card.

#### Optional Rules

You may not aid a Hobbit facing an automatic-attack alone because he failed a burglary role.

After a succesful burglary attempt, another character may tap to play a minor item.

If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the character, the second strike is considered succesful.

A character tapping to face two strikes is at -3 prowess against both strikes. The character taps when resolving the second strike.

In multi-player games the following hazards count as 1/2 a creature: hazards that can be played as events or creatures, Ahunt Dragon manifestations, and At Home Dragon manifestations.

## V. Tournament Rulings

Tournament rulings are modifications and additions to the rules presented in the Unlimited Edition rulesbook that are required for sanctioned Council of Lórien tournament play.

#### General

Dice must be used to obtain random numbers.

There is now a required 30 card minimum for both resources and hazards for sanctioned tournament play.

Cards that can be played as either hazards or resources (can we say Twilight boys and girls?) may count as either.

Up to 3 copies of one Wizard is allowed in a play deck, or up to 2 copies of one Wizard and 1 copy of another Wizard. One copy of three different Wizards is not allowed.

#### Deck Construction

There is a Council of Lórien creature minimum of 12 creatures. Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.

A hazard that can be played as a creature or an event counts as 1/2 a creature.

At Home and Ahunt Dragon manifestations count as 1/2 a creature for the Council of Lórien creature minimum.

#### The Character Draft

The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.

Each player reveals one character at a time from their pool, simultaneously with their opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into the starting parties, duplicated charcters are put aside and not allowed in either starting company. Each player continues until they want to stop, they have 20 points of mind in their starting company, or they have five characters in their starting company.

If one player stops revealing characters, the other one may continue to play charcters.

No player may reveal a character that would bring his starting company's total mind over 20.

When players are finished, each may put up to 10 characters into their deck, including character from his starting pool that did not end up in the starting company.

#### Map Movement

Maps of the regions of METW may be used in place of region cards in Council of Lorien tournaments. If two companies move on the same turn, then the second company does not have to determine it's site path until the begining of it's movement/hazard phase.

#### The Weakest Link Method

If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption point to each non-Wizard in play. Each character then makes a corruption check and marshalling points are recounted.

Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all non-Wizard characters are corrupted away.

## VI. Card Errata and Rulings

Alatar can interfere with the attacker assigning strike. When he uses his special ability he must face a strike.

#### Assassin

All of the strikes will go against the same character.

#### Dragon's Hunger

Errata: Replace "Otherwise, the attack is cancelled." with "Otherwise, the attack is cancelled and the opponent must reveal his hand."

–=– The White Tree in play does not at all restrict agent movement. The White Tree makes Minas Tirith a Haven for the purposes of playing hazards, but an agent moving to Minas Tirith is not playing the agent. Playing a card is the action of taking it out of your hand. –=–

#### The Windlord Found Me

–=– Can be used to recover a Wizard discarded with Sacrifice of Form. –=–

–=– You can play your Wizard at the Haven when you store this card even if Saw Further and Deeper is in play. –=–

#### Wizard's Ring

Has errata: Replace "Ignore any effect that would discard this item" with "Cannot be stored, stolen, or transfered." –=–

## VII. Dark Minions Rulings

Cards from _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_ may be used in Council of Lórien constructed deck tournaments after December 5, 1996. Cards from _MEDM_ may be used in Council of Lórien sealed deck play immediately.
 
In Rules Insert, under Agents, Agent Acitons (errata)

A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move from tapped status to utapped status). This agent action does not appear in the rules insert. This rule is correct and should be considered as though it were printed in the rules insert.
 
In Rules Insert, under Agents, Playing Creatures at an Agent's Site (errata)

In the second paragraph of this section, replace: "If one of your agents and one of your opponent's companies are both at the agent's home site, " with "If one of your agents is at his home site and one of your opponent's companies is at or moving to that site,
 
Agents (clarification)--Agents are not hazard creatures. They are their own class of hazards. They count as hazards for deck construction.
 
Agents (clarification)--Agents do not work for your Wizard. As any hazard, agents represent the bad forces of Middle-earth whose inclusion in your deck on a simulation level is independent of your Wizards's efforts.
 
Agents (clarification)---Agents cannot attack or influence each other.
 
Agents (clarification)---Agent attacks are not keyed to a site, and thusly, cannot be cancelled with Not at Home, etc.
 
Agent movement (clarification)---A tapped agent can move. Tapping is not condition of agent movement, it is an effect of agent movement.
 
Influencing with an Agent (clarification)---An influence attempt by an agent does not count against the hazard limit in and of itself. Nor does it count as an agent action. Playing a hazard event that allows an agent to make an influence attempt does count against the hazard limit.
 
Attacking with an Agent (clarification)---Playing a card that makes an agent attack is considered the attack's declaration. Thus, if an agent is face down when Cunning Foes is played on him, he receives all the face down bonuses.

–=– Underdeeps (clarification)-Marshalling points with companies at an Under-deeps site only do not count for the purposes of actually calling the Free Council. They do count at the actual Council itself. –=–

Under-deep site movement (clarification)---When a company's site of origin is an Under-deeps site and the company reveals a new site at the start of its movement/hazard phase, the company is declaring it will make a roll to determine if the movement was successful. No cards can be played between the site being revealed and the roll except for Reach of Ulmo.
 
Under-deep site movement (clarification)---If you move to an Under-deeps site from a tapped surface site, the tapped surface site is dicarded at the end of the company's movement/hazard phase. The discarded surface site is not available until it is returned to your location deck. The moral of this story is: do not tap your surface site when moving to an Under-deeps site unless you are prepared to leave the Under-deeps site via another Under-deeps site.
 
Under-deep site movement (clarification)---Goldberry cannot prevent a company from returning to its site of origin that failed its roll to move to an adjacent Under-deeps site.
 
Taking Prisoner---Allies cannot be targetted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot be taken prisoner.
 
Rescue Attempts---At an Under-deeps site, after a successul rescue attempt, a character can tap for a minor item only. This is despite the fact that with the play of resources that tap an Under-deeps site, a character could tap for any playable item.

Baduila (clarification)---Read "If Baduila is discarded" as "If you choose to discard Baduila." It is something you choose to do.

Golodhros (clarification)---He may use his special influence ability only during an opponent's movement/hazard phase, not during the site phase. His tapping to use his special ability does not count against the hazard limit.
 
Great Secrets Buried There (clarification)---The item placed under this card is considered in play for the purposes of uniqueness, just like any card placed off to the side.

Hermit's Hill (clarification)---Unless a card specifically states otherwise, to play any item at a site, the site must be untapped. To play a major item here, Hermit's Hill must be untapped. 

Hidden Knife (clarification)---Hidden Knife is effectively an attack. As per Annotation 15 in The Companion, attacks must be the first items declared in a chain of effects, Hidden Knife must be so played. Thus, if your opponent reveals an agent during your site phase and attacks with it, you must wait until after this attack to play Hidden Knife.
 
Lure of Power (clarification)---This card is in no way affected by an influence attempt of an agent.
 
Mallorn (errata)---The first sentence should read: "Playable at Bag End only if Earth of Galadriel's Orchard is stored there."

My Precious (clarification)---Does not count as Gollum for the purposes of Gollum's Fate or any other card that specifically calls for Gollum.

Noble Hound (errata)---Add the sentence: "If Noble Hound is tapped or wounded, treat it as though it were untapped for the purposes of assigning strikes."
 
The Old Thrush (clarification)---Can only be used on agents whose listed prowess is 13 or greater, not whose prowess plus dice roll is 13 or greater. Presently, there are no agents with this listed prowess.

The White Tree (clarification)---The White Tree in play does not at all restrict agent movement. The White Tree makes Minas Tirith a Haven for the purposes of playing hazards, but an agent moving to Minas Tirith is not playing the agent. Playing a card is the action of taking it out of your hand.

The Windlord Found Me (clarification)---Can be used to recover a Wizard discarded with Sacrifice of Form.

The Windlord Found Me (clarification)---You can play your Wizard at the Haven when you store this card even if Saw Further and Deeper is in play.

The Under-galleries (clarification)---You cannot play Morannon at The Under-galleries. However, you can play Ancient Stair from Morannon, move to The Under-galleries, and zip back to Morannon at the end of the turn.
