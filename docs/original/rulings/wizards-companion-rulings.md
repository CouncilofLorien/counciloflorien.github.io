# MIDDLE-EARTH<br>THE WIZARDS COMPANION

## • PART V •<br>ERRATA AND CLARIFICATIONS

The following list details card errata and clarifications. This list is official. If a card lists an errata, it means the text on the card is wrong or incomplete. If a card lists a clarification, it means that the text on the card could be ambiguous. All of these errata changes have been made on Unlimited Edition cards (i.e., blue bordered cards).

_Akhorahil_ (errata)—Replace "…gives -1 penalty to one character's body checks this turn." with "…modifies any one character's body by -1 for the rest of the turn."

_Align Palantir_ (clarification)—An aligned Palantir can be stored.

_Army of the Dead_ (errata)—May not be influenced by an opponent.

_Bane of the Ithil-stone_ (clarification)—This card cancels any action that _literally_ causes any player to search through or look at any portion of _any_ play deck or discard pile outside the normal sequence of play. E.g., this card cancels _Vilya_, which would otherwise allow Elrond's player to choose 5 cards from his discard pile and shuffle them into his play deck. This card does not cancel each player's card drawing option when a company reveals a new site, but it does cancel _Lucky Search_. This card does not affect an action which allows a player to bring cards from his sideboard into his discard pile or play deck. This card does not affect an action which otherwise only causes a player to reshuffle his play deck.
