# Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game

Collected Official Rulings File
{: .text-center .text-beta}

Version 10 current as of January 1, 1998
{: .text-center }

## Collected Rulings

This is version 10 of the collected clarifications to the rules for the
Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game, up to January 1, 1998. Some of these
clarifications are considered errata to the rules or cards, and are noted as
such. The Turn Sequence and Rulings by Term sections are specifically
considered clarifications to the rules, and are therefore overridden by card
text that specifically does so. A complete list of errata is included on the
back page of this booklet. There will be periodic updates to this booklet, and
items marked with a "@" are new or changed since the last version.
New rulings that clarify ambiguous situtations take effect immediately.

Reversals of old rulings, changes to the rules, and new rulings not covering
ambiguous situations will not have an effect on tournament play until two to
four weeks after they are made. Every other Monday, starting November 3, 1997,
will be a Rulings Monday. On a Rulings Monday, delayed rulings that have been
made will be announced on the internet, and rulings that were announced on the
previous Rulings Monday will take effect.

The main thing to remember, when making rulings based on the rules and the
cards, is that if it isn't there, then it isn't there. If a card says a site
counts as a Haven for purposes of healing, that does not mean the site counts
as a Haven for any other purposes. If a card says it can be played as a
resource, that does not mean it counts as a resource at any time except when
it is being played. Remember: If it isn't there, it isn't there.

Tournament rules for MECCG differ slightly from the rules for casual play.
Rulings marked with a "#" differ from those in tournament play. When playing
in a tournament, be sure to check the Tournament Rulings section.

If you have any further questions concerning MECCG, you can either:
 - Write Iron Crown Enterprises at P.O. Box 1605, Charlottesville, VA, 22902.
 - Email the official rules representative, Craig "Ichabod" O'Brien, at \<ichabod cstone.net>
 - Post the message to the Usenet news group rec.games.trading-cards.misc, with "\[MECCG]" in the subject line, or
 - Join the official MECCG mailing list by sending a message to listproc tower.ml.org with "subscribe metw" and your email address in the body of the message.

## Turn Sequence Rulings

## Beginning of the Game
\# If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in the starting
company, then it does not count against the 10 character limit.

\# You should either draw numbers for the whole game or roll dice for the
whole game.

### Untap Phase
Corruption checks triggered at the end of the untap phase happen after
everyone untaps.

### Organization Phase

#### Choosing a New Site
Rules Erratum: When a company splits, any of the resulting companies can
move with region movement. Region movement is not limited to one company of a
split.
Any single site path cannot have more than one copy of a particular region.
Any company may declare as its new site a site already on the table. That
site will remain on the table at least until the end of that company's
movement/hazard phase.
Two companies may not start at the same site of origin and move to the same
new site.
Effects that are played during the organization phase, and depend on the
site or site path of a moving company, create an effect which is not declared
until the new site is revealed. If the site or site path is not of the
appropriate type when the effect resolves, the resource has no effect. If the
company has multiple movement/hazard phases on the same turn, the card applies
separately to each phase, having an effect only if the correct conditions are
met.

#### Followers
A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence against "Blue Mountain
Dwarves" to control characters with the home site Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold.
The bonus only applies to the faction.
Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only once, not for
each character.

#### Organizing Companies
When a company splits up, its player chooses which characters are the
original company and which characters are a new company, unless otherwise
directed by a card. All resource permanent-events played on the original
company stay with the original company.
Company composition changes that you choose to make, including bringing a
character into play, must all be done at the same time during the organization
phase. During this time no other actions may be taken.
See also Rulings by Term, Company and Influence

#### Playing Characters
Rules Erratum: You may play a character if you do not have enough influence
to control them. However, if there are any characters you do not have the
influence to control at the end of your organization phase, the character you
brought into play this turn must be returned to your hand.
@ If you play a Ringwraith at a non-Darkahven site where there is one of your
non-Ringwraith comapnies, one of the companies must move that turn. If both
companies are still there at the end of the movement/hazard phase, discard
the non-Rinwraith company.

#### Storing Items
Minions who roll equal to or one less than their accumulated corruption
when storing an item are only tapped.
A minion who taps from a corruption check for storing/transferring an item
still successfully stores/transfers that item.

### Long Event Phase

### Movement/Hazard Phase

#### General
Annotation 25: A company is considered to be at the site given by its site
card at all times except from the moment their new site card is revealed
during their movement/hazard phase until their old site card is discarded
during the same movement/hazard phase. During this period a company is
considered to be en route between sites and not at any site.
Annotation 25a: A company's movement/hazard phase is concluded when a
moving company removes its site of origin and both players agree to reconcile
(discard down to/draw up to) their hand sizes. No resources (and obviously no
hazards) can be playedÂçünd no resource effects can be activated until the site
phase or until both players have drawn cards for the movement of a following
company.
Annotation 25b: Players drawing cards when a new site is revealed is
synonymous with the resolution of the new site being revealed. It happens
immediately, not in the following chain of effects.
Annotation 26: If at the start of a player's movement/hazard phase, there
are multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order
they are applied, the player who is currently not taking his turn (i.e., the
hazard player) decides the order in which they are to be applied. Once this
interpretation is established, all further actions are applied in the order
they are resolved for the rest of the turn.
Once the effects of an environment card have been applied to a target
during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again to that
target during the current turn.
When you draw cards for movement, you may continue drawing cards until you
either want to stop, or have drawn the number of cards allowed for the
movement.
Companies at the same non-Haven/non-Darkhaven site must join at the end of
all movement/hazard phases, before the site phase starts. Companies at the
same Haven/Darkhaven site may join at this time.
If companies would join at the end of the movement/hazard phase such that
the company composition rules are violated, one company of the hazard player's
choice must return to its site of origin.
If two companies join at a site, cards affecting one of the companies now
affect them both.
Removing the site of origin and resetting to hand size are simultaneous
actions, and they are the last actions in any movement/hazard phase. This
means a moving company is not at a site until the site phase. \[effective
11/17/97]

#### Movement

#### General
If a company does not move, it still has a movement/hazard phase. No cards
are drawn based on the company's movement, and the only hazards that can be
played on the company are creatures that can be keyed to the company's site
and events.
Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they look that way on
some maps.
If a company moves twice in one turn, resources played during the
organization phase, like Secret Passage, are reapplied to the company at the
beginning of each of their movement/hazard phases, if the conditions of the
card are met.
If both players have access to region movement, then neither player may
be stopped from using region movement. Access includes region cards or an
appropriate map.

#### Playing Hazards
Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an
effect, and this does not count against the hazard limit unless specified
otherwise on the card. \[effective 11/17/97]
Hazards may only be played on a company whose movement/hazard phase is
being resolved, or on the site they are moving to. Long-events and permanent-
events may effect more than one company even though they are only played "on"
one company.
If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a region type, those
region types do not have to be consecutive in the site path.
If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent plays a resource
before the movement/hazard phase ends, you may then resume playing hazards,
assuming you have not yet reached the hazard limit.
If a company is moving from a surface site to an Under-deeps site, hazards
may not be played keyed to the region of the surface site.
Angmar Arises, In Darkness Bind Them, and Reaching Shadow may not be used
to play creatures keyed to double shadow-lands.
A creature "played at" a site is the same as being "keyed to" the site.
A creature "played at a site in" a region is the same as being "keyed to"
the site by name.
For the purposes of interpreting hazards, no Darkhaven or Haven has a
site path except Geann a-Lisch.

#### Returning to Site of Origin
If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path immediately
disappears, and its movement/hazard phase immediately ends.
An effect that returns a company to its site of origin may not be declared
in the middle of an attack.

#### Combat

#### General
Side effects of losing a character are resolved immediately after the
character is lost, before other characters resolve their strikes.
All strikes of an attack must be assigned before any are resolved.
See also Rulings by Term, Body Check; and Turn Sequence, Site Phase,
Company vs. Company Combat.

#### Attack
Annotation 12: An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded when
the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final strike, and the
associated body check are resolved.
Annotation 13: An attack may not be canceled once its strikes have been
assigned. A strike may not be canceled once the dice-roll for the strike has
been made.
Annotation 14: A canceled attack has no effect on its target company,
except that the company is considered in its history to have faced the attack.
Annotation 15: An attack must be the first declared action in a chain of
effects, i.e., a creature card may not be played in response to another card
in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception.
In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an attack, the character
doing so must be in the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site
type a hazard creature was keyed to can be affected otherwise.
Cards only modify attacks if they say they specifically mention attacks.
When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the MPs, the creature
goes to the out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played the attack.
They may still be taken as a trophy, but go to the appropriate out-of-play
pile when the trophy is discarded.
Excess strikes applied as -1 modifiers do not have to have their body
defeated.
If an attack states all characters in a company face a strike, then effects
which allow a character to face more than one strike have no effect against
the attack. Similarly, effects that change the attack's number of strikes have
no effect. As an exception, effects which reduce the number of strikes to a
specific number do work.
Any effect that would change the number of strikes for an attack may not be
played after strikes are assigned. This includes cards that have other
additional effects, and cards that only indirectly change the number of
strikes.
Attacks created by events are not keyed to anything unless specifically
stated as being keyed to something on the card.
There are three levels of cards which reassign strikes. Alatar is the top
level, and overrides any other conflicting card which changes the assignment
of strikes. Cards which say they "always" or "in all cases" change the
assignment of strikes are the next level, and override any other conflicting
effects except Alatar. Cards which say they change the assignment of strikes
"regardless of ..." certain factors are the third level, and are overridden by
all other effects from conflicting cards. If two effects on the same level
conflict, the resource overrides the hazard.
@ If an attack can not be cancelled, strikes from the attack may still be
cancelled.

#### The Strike Sequence
Annotation 16: When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is considered
in his history to have been wounded and must face any special actions the
wounding strike presented him.
Annotation 17: The only actions that may be declared during a strike
sequence are those outlined in Annotation 18.
Annotation 18: When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike against
a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by either player
until the strike dice-roll is made are the following: playing hazard cards
that affect the strike, the attacker may decide to use any or all of his
remaining -1 modifications due to strikes in excess of the company's size, a
target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not
automatically tap, and the defending character may play resource cards that
affect the strike. An action that has the condition that a target character
tap, but which otherwise has an effect not outlined here, may not be declared
at this point. This is true even if the recipient of the strike would be the
target character tapping and thus receive -1 to his prowess.
Annotation 19: Following each successful strike or failed strike, a body
check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However, if the
strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded
by "William" may be required to discard his items), these special actions are
resolved before the body check. The body check is the first declared action in
a nested chain of effects that immediately follows the strike dice-roll and
special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions may be declared in
response to a body check, in the same chain of effects, but these are limited
to those actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. E.g., Tookish
Blood could not be declared in response to the body check caused by Giant
Spiders wounding a Hobbit. No action may be declared in response to a special
action resulting from a strike unless the special action is a dice-rolling
action, i.e., a special action is generally considered synonymous with the
strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling action, an action
may be declared in response to it if the action directly affects the dice-
roll.
Annotation 20: If more than one special action is to follow a strike, the
defending player decides the order they are resolved.
Annotation 21: A successful strike against a character is synonymous with
that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the playing
surface is not a separate action from the successful strike.
Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general, wounded characters
are not considered tapped.
Non-item prowess bonuses are applied in the order the player controlling
the character decides.
If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the
character, the second strike is considered successful.
There is time between the strike sequences to take actions that are
otherwise legal.

### Site Phase

#### General
Items, factions and allies must be played during the site phase.
There is no one resource card per site phase rule. However, the tapping of
the site usually limits you to one card per site phase.
The site taps upon successful play of the resource that would tap it.
A company may not play any resource during the site phase until they have
faced all automatic-attacks, unless that resource directly affects an
automatic-attack. Removing an automatic-attack does not directly affect it,
although cancelling does.
You may only play a free minor item after playing an ally, faction,
or item that taps the site.

#### Company vs. Company Combat
The defender may take actions that affect the attack or any of the strikes.
The attacker may only take actions that affect individual strikes.
True Fana and Sacrifice of Form cannot be used in company versus company
combat.
Hazards have no effect on company vs. company combat.

#### Exploring A Site/Automatic-attacks
A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an automatic-attack, and this
counts as facing the automatic-attack.
Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the normal automatic-
attacks for the site. Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in the order listed
and/or resolved.
Company composition and overt/covert status is checked before each
automatic attack.
Any character may tap to cancel one automatic-attack at his home site.

#### Influence Attempts
It is not possible to influence an item away from a Wizard or Ringwraith.
You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.
A successful influence attempt on an opponent's resource does not tap the
site.
You may only make one influence attempt against your opponent's resources
during each turn.

#### On-Guard Cards
Rules Erratum: An on-guard card may only be revealed if it could have also
been played during the movement/hazard phase. This means all targets of the
card must have existed during the movement/hazard phase in order for the card
to be revealed.
A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as though it were both
declared and resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects during which
it was revealed.
An on-guard card may be revealed when the company plays a resource that
potentially taps the site. The card must affect the company or a character in
the company that site phase. Note that this clarification is looser than the
rule printed on p.61 of the Unlimited Rules book
A successful ring test does not allow an on-guard card to be revealed.
You may reveal a card in response to an influence attempt against a faction
even if the on-guard card only has an effect if the attempt is successful. You
may also reveal a card in response to such an attempt that affects the actual
influence attempt.
Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be considered when
determining the validity of revealing an on-guard card. Potential effects that
have not been triggered cannot be considered.

A card cannot be revealed that:

 - Returns a company to its site of origin.
 - Taps a company's site.
 - Potentially removes a character from a company, besides combat or corruption checks.
 - Forces a company to do nothing during its site phase.
 - Directly taps a character in the company.

A card that potentially removes an ally from the company can be revealed,
so long as it otherwise is legal.
The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's hand.
When an on-guard card is revealed, it immediately ceases to be considered
an on-guard card.
See also Rulings By Term, Burglary Attempts

#### End-of-Turn Phase

End-of-Turn effects are triggered by the ending of the End-of-Turn phase.
Once both players are done with all actions in the End-of-Turn phase, all End-
of-Turn effects are declared and resolved in the order chosen by the current
player. No further actions may be declared that turn.
Cards may be played during the End-of-Turn phase after hand size has been
reconciled.
Replacing one site with another at the end of the turn counts as movement,
without a movement/hazard phase.

#### Free Council

These rulings apply to any end game, whether it is the Free Council, the
Audience with Sauron, or the Day of Reckoning.
Characters may tap to aid corruption checks, if they are in the same
company.
Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have an effect.
@ Only resources that directly affect corruption checks may be played during
the Free Council. This includes cards that change a character's corruption
point total or prevent a character from being discarded.
@ When determining if more than half of your marshalling points come from one
type of marshalling point, ignore negative marshalling points. The easy way to
do this is if one category is more than half of your positive marshalling
points, reduce that category to equal all of your other positive marshalling
point categories combined.
@ To calculate marshalling points at the Free Council, follow these steps:
 1. Total up the marshalling points for each category. The modifications from My Precious, factions played on a leader, and eliminated characters apply now.
 2. If your opponent has no points in a category double your points in that category. Doubling does not apply to the Miscellaneous or Kill categories.
 3. If one of your categories accounts for more than half of your positive marshalling point total, reduce it so that it has the same number of points as the rest of your positive categories combined.
 4. Subtract any points that are subtracted from your total, including points from unique resources your opponent has duplicated in his hand.

You may only call the Free Council if you have met the deck cycling and
marshalling point requirments, not if only your opponent has.

## Rulings By Term

### -= AAA =-

#### Actions
Tapping a resource can only be done at a time when you could otherwise play
a resource event.

#### Active Conditions
An active condition must be in play or established when the action
requiring it is declared. Active conditions serve as the price of an action.
They are restrictions on the player invoking the action.
Annotation 5: If an action requires an entity to tap as a condition for the
action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is
declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this point;
this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a
separate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of
effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is
canceled.
Annotation 6: If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a
condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the
action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the action's
declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action.
Annotation 7: If any other active condition for an action does not exist
when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action was
playing a card from your hand, it is discarded.
Annotation 8: An action that requires a target is considered to have the
active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared and
when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in
play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions
declared later in the same chain of effects.
When a card mentions an alternate use, the active conditions given in the
beginning of the card text need only be met if they are also mentioned by the
alternate use.
Your opponent's resources may be the active conditions for your resources,
but may not be the targets for your resources.
See also Rulings by Term, Target

#### Agent
Rules Erratum: A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move from
tapped status to utapped status).
Rules Erratum: An agent may tap to play creatures at a site if the company
is moving to the site.
Playing a card that makes an agent attack is considered the attack's
declaration.
Agents are not creatures.
Rolls made by agents during combat are done simultaneously with rolls made
by characters during combat, after step 4 of the strike sequence.
Only face-up agents are considered for uniqueness.
While in play agents played as hazards may not become minion characters,
and agents played as minion characters may not become hazards.
An agent played as a character in a Ringwraith deck can only be played at
his home site.
When constructing a Ringwraith deck, agents are always considered
characters. The maximum of 36 mind of agents in your sideboard and play deck
combined still applies.
To wound an agent you only need to defeat the prowess of one strike. To
eliminate an agent you must defeat the prowess and body for all strikes.
Revealed agents may return to their home site, even if they are at one of
their home sites.
Cards played on an agent remain face up when the agent turns face down.
Agents may not move to any version of a hero Haven, unless they have a
special ability allowing them to.
@ Fallen-wizards use minion rules for agents, except where specified by the
White Hand rules insert.
See also Rulings by Term, Card Effect Limitations.

#### Ahunt Manifestations
If one Ahunt is out and you move through two or more of the regions listed
on it, then you face the attack once.

#### Ally
Allies may tap to cancel attacks from Slayers and Assassins.
Allies cannot be targeted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot be
taken prisoner.
If an ally may not be attacked by certain attacks, he may still tap to give
+1 prowess to characters facing such attacks.
Playing an ally is not an influence attempt.
If an ally's controller leaves play for any reason, that ally is discarded.
Allies can be healed as if they were characters. Otherwise, allies are only
considered characters for the purposes of combat and playing skill cards.

### -= BBB =-

#### Burglary Attempts
After a successful burglary attempt, another character may tap to play a
minor item.
The character who fails the burglary roll must face the automatic-attack as
though he were a one-character company. He can receive no combat support other
than what he himself can provide.
On-guard creatures are faced by the whole company after a Burglaring
attempt, regardless of the success of the attempt.

#### Body Check
Annotation 22: When a character fails a body check, his items may be
immediately reassigned to unwounded characters in his company, one item per
character. Reassigning of the eliminated character's items is considered to be
synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between
the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are discarded.
Effects that modify a character's body also modify the number an Orc or
Troll would be discarded on. A maximum to body applies equally to the discard
number.
If an Orc or Troll could be discarded and eliminated by a result, discard
them instead of eliminating them.
"Affecting the body check" includes modifying the die roll or the body of
the character making the check.
See also Movement/Hazard Phase, Combat, General.

### -= CCC =-

#### Cannot be Duplicated
Short-events that cannot be duplicated cannot be played if a card of the
same name is currently having an effect on play.
Annotation 11 (modified from its original version): Some cards cannot be
duplicated in limited cases -- generally on a specific target. Multiple copies
of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each
applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated can be played
when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being
targeted by an effect that will discard it.

#### Card Effect Limitations
You may not play the following cards if your opponent is a Ringwraith or
Sauron. Additionally, if you are not a Ringwraith or Sauron, a Ringwraith or
Sauron opponent can play these cards against you and not be affected by any of
their global effects.

 - All hazard events that require an agent\*
 - Bane of the Ithil-stone
 - The Black Enemy's Wrath
 - Foul Fumes
 - In the Heart of His Realm
 - Mordor in Arms
 - Mumak
 - Worn and Famished

\*Near to Hear a Whisper and Sudden Fury from Middle-earth: Against the
Shadow and Great Need or Purpose may be played because they do not target a
specific agent.
The following cards are also listed in the MELE Rules book as having no
effect on a Ringwraith/Sauron player, but this interpretation has been
modified.
Chance of Being Lost and Winds of Wrath: You may play these cards against
any opponent who is using the same type of location deck (hero sites or minion
sites) as yourself.
Great Secrets Buried There: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or
Sauron player one month after the release of Middle-earth: Against the Shadow.
The Nazgul are Abroad: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or
Sauron player. The only restriction is that the first two paragraphs are
ignored when you play Nazgul creatures against a Ringwraith or Sauron
opponent. Any player can recycle Nazgul hazards as stated on the card.

#### Character
A character enacting an effect counts as a character in his company, and
may affect himself as a character in the company.
A character in play must always be in one of three independent states:
untapped, tapped, or wounded.
You can have three of a non-unique character in your deck.
Prowess modification due to tapped and wounded status apply only
during the strike sequence.

See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Followers and Playing
Characters

#### Company
If all characters in a company are removed from the company, all resource
permanent-events played on the company as a whole are discarded.
If all characters in a company leave play, the site goes to the location
deck or discard pile, depending on its tapped status. If this happens during
the movement/hazard phase, the site card stays in play until the end of all
movement/hazard phases. In this case, on-guard cards may still be played on
the site.
The following allies make a company overt: The Balrog, Creature of an Older
World, Great Bats, Great Lord of Goblin-gate, Last Child of Ungoliant,
Regiment of Black Crows, and "Two-headed" Troll.
Entities associated with a company include the characters, allies, and
items in the company, and any events played on the company or on another
entity in the company. The new site and site of origin are not entities
associated with the company.
See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Organizing Companies; and
Rulings by Term, Influence.

#### Corruption
Annotation 23: When a character fails a corruption check, the standard
effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or eliminated and his
items being discarded) are implemented immediately and are considered
synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may
modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g. The Precious), but this
timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., Traitor, which do not cause
a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive
condition of a failed check, take effect as the first declared action in a
chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the
corruption check.
Characters with 0 corruption points must still make corruption checks.
A character may attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping. The
roll is at -3.
You can not attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping if you have
attempted to remove that card already this turn. You may not tap to remove a
corruption card that you tried to remove without tapping already this turn.
The resolution of a character tapping to give +1 to a corruption check
happens when the corruption check itself resolves.
If an effect is in play that prevents a character from being discarded, the
character is not considered to fail his corruption check if a result is
achieved that would discard him. A Wizard would not be eliminated and his
player would not lose the game.
A character attempting to remove a corruption card on another character
may ignore the tapping requirement and recieve a -3 to the roll.
See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Storing Items.

### -= DDD =-

#### Darkhaven
Rules Erratum: Attacks keyed to Darkhavens are detainment. \[effective
11/17/97]
Whenever a hazard affecting heroes refers to a Darkhaven, interpret it as
referring to a Haven instead.
Attacks at Darkhavens are canceled only if the company is at the Darkhaven.
Darkhavens count as their own nearest Darkhaven.

#### Detainment Attacks
When a strike from a detainment attack succeeds, the character who was
facing that particular strike must tap.
Attacks that have special effects when they wound a character do not have
that effect when they are detainment attacks. This is because detainment
attacks never wound a character.

#### Discard
A discarded non-Wizard/non-Ringwraith character may be brought into play
again by any player.
When a card is discarded, so are all permanent-events on that card.
Cards discarded from a player's hand must be discarded one at a time. This
is mainly to allow a Pallando player to see each card as it is discarded.
Whenever a character is discarded, all non-follower cards played with that
character are also discarded.
If a card leaves active play, including being returned to a player's hand,
it immediately ceases having an effect on play. [effective 11/3/97]

#### Dragons
Dragon automatic-attacks are not considered manifestations of any unique
Dragon.
If a manifestation of a unique Dragon is defeated, then the autmatic-attack
at the associated site is removed, and that site therefore loses its hoard
status.

### -= EEE =-

#### Eliminated
When a card is eliminated, all permanent-events on that card are discarded.

#### Exhausted
Permanent-events discarded when the play deck is exhausted are shuffled
into the new play deck along with the rest of the discard pile.

### -= GGG =-

#### Gold Ring Item
When a gold ring item is tested, the ring is discarded and its marshalling
points are lost whether or not you are able to play a special item.
Ring special items played as a result of storing a ring at a Darkhaven come
into play stored.

### -= HHH =-

#### Hand Size
Effects which increase your hand size or allow you to hold one more card in
your hand mean that you draw up to your new hand size or discard down to it at
the appropriate points during the game.
Effects which increase hand size are cumulative.
See also Card Errata and Rulings, Favor of the Valar.

#### Haven
Havens can tap.
Whenever a hazard affecting minions refers to a Haven, interpret it as
referring to a Darkhaven instead.
Havens count as their own nearest Haven.

#### Hobbits
If a Hobbit is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be
brought back into play normally at Bag End.

### -= III =-

#### Influence
Restricted direct influence is limited in its use, usually to characters
and/or factions of specific races. Unrestricted influence has no use
restrictions.
When a character suffers a minus to direct influence, it must come from
unrestricted direct influence first. If there is no unrestricted influence and
there are multiple instances of restricted direct influence, the player may
choose which restricted direct influence the minus is applied to.
A character removed from the control of direct influence outside the
organization phase does not need to be controlled by general influence until
that player's next organization phase.
See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Followers and Organizing
Companies; and Rulings by Term, Company.
Changes to general influence take place immediately, with a minimum of zero
free general influence.

#### Items
The "free" minor item may only be played immediately after playing the
resource that taps that site.

### -= MMM =-

#### Marshalling Point Pile
Under standard rules, no more than half of your marshalling points can come
from any one type of marshalling point. Do not round up. The easiest way to
deal with this is to set the category with the most marshalling points to
equal the total of all other categories of marshalling points.
You may not target hazards in your opponent's marshalling point pile for
removal.
You may not gain marshalling points from a hazard you played yourself.

#### May not Untap
Nothing may untap a character who is the subject of an effect that states
the character may not untap.

#### MELE vs. METW
Hero items may not be used as conditions for minion resources, and minion
items may not be used as conditions for hero resources. Note that a Fallen-
wizard may play special ring items regardless of the alignment of the gold
ring item tested.
\# If you are playing against a deck with three Wizards in it, you may play
any combination of three Ringwraiths, except one each of three different
Ringwraiths.
You may not have both the minion and hero version of a unique item in your
deck.

#### Minion characters
Minion characters are not affected by cards that target agents.

#### Modes
When one mode effect is applied to a Ringwraith, all other cards applying a
mode effect to that Ringwraith are discarded.
When a Ringwraith is in a mode, only apply the effects listed on the mode
card, on the Ringwraith, and in the rules for that mode. Do not worry about
cards that are not in play.

#### Multi-player Games
Only the moving player, and the hazard player drawing cards based on his
movement, may take advantage of drawing cards, including cards drawn for
events like The Nazgul are Abroad and From the Pits of Angband. These two
players are also the only ones who may discard a card at the end of the turn.
All players reset their hand size when any turn or movement/hazard phase
ends.
In multi-player games the following hazards count as 1/2 a creature:
hazards that can be played as events or creatures, Ahunt Dragon
manifestations, and At Home Dragon manifestations. Agents in a Wizard deck
also count as 1/2 creatures.
You may only play The Lidless Eye if none of your opponents are
Ringwraiths.
Twilight may only be played by the moving player and the hazard player. As
an exception, a player who's own environment will be discarded by an
environment may play Twilight to cancel that environment.
For Spying out the Land and Here is a Snake, each hazard player shows
hazards immediately before he draws and/or plays hazards, and then can only
play those hazards. Players who are not playing hazards are not required to
show hazards.

### -= NNN =-

#### Normal
Normal means as written on the card, not considering other card's effects.
Note that this definition only applies to affects refering to card texts.

#### Nazgul
If a Nazgul is tapped to become a short-event as printed on its card, it
turns into a short-event upon declaration. At this point, the Nazgul is a
short-event just as if had been played as such from your hand.
The body referred to in the text of female characters with combat bonuses
against Nazgul is the body of the Nazgul

### -= OOO =-

#### Off to the Side
Host cards of cards off to the side can be targeted normally.

#### Optional Rules
If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the
character, the second strike is considered successful.
A character tapping to face two strikes is at -3 prowess against both
strikes. The character taps when resolving the second strike.
For recently visited sites in multi-player games, the automatic-attack gets
+1 for each player who has that site in their discard pile.
See also Rulings by Term, Burglary Attempts.

### -= PPP =-

#### Passive Conditions
A passive condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already
in play.
Annotation 9: If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of
some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first
action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of
effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when
this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action
is canceled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set
of rules.
Annotation 9a: If a card is required to be discarded by some passive
condition, the card is discarded immediately when the condition resolves, not
in the following chain of effects.
Annotation 10: If more than one action is required to be the first action
declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order
in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up
chain until the multiple required actions have been declared.
A card causing an action as a result of a passive condition must be in play
when the action resolves, or else the action is canceled.

#### Playing a Card
Playing a card is the process of bringing a card from your hand into play.
@ You may not play a card which has no effect on the game. Causing a dice
roll is considered to be having an effect on the game.

### -= RRR =-

#### Reveal
Any revealed cards are shown to all players.

#### Ringwraith
You may have any number of Ringwraiths in your sideboard, as long as you do
not duplicate more than one of them in the combined deck and sideboard.
Characters with combat bonuses against Nazgul also get those bonuses
against Ringwraiths. However, other effects that affect Nazgul do not affect
Ringwraiths.
Ringwraith may not move from a non-Darkhaven site to another non-Darkhaven
site unless they are using Dwar Unleashed. This means a Ringwraith may not
move to Under-deeps sites that do not have a Darkhaven for a surface site.

#### Ringwraith Follower
Ringwraith followers may still use magic as printed on their card.
When your revealed Ringwraith leaves play without being eliminated, you
have until the end of your next organization phase to bring your Ringwraith
back into play, and use him to re-control any Ringwraith followers. Otherwise,
all Ringwraith followers are discarded.

### -= SSS =-

#### Sage Only
Any card requiring a sage to play is a sage only card.

#### Short-event
Short-events are discarded when resolved in a chain of effects, not when
declared. Thus, they can be targeted by certain special effects in the chain
of effects.

#### Sideboard
The sideboard is increased to 25 cards.
You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent's Wizard is
in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent's untap phase and
then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgul permanent-event to do so.
The hazard limit against all of your opponent's companies that turn is halved,
rounded up.
Tapping a Nazgul to bring cards in from the sideboard does not turn the
Nazgul into a short-event. It is discarded immediately upon declaration.
You may have Wizards in your sideboard. You may have no more than three
copies of one Wizard, and one copy of each other Wizard, in your sideboard and
play deck combined.

#### Site
To untap a site the character doing so must be at that site.

#### Site Path
Certain cards refer to the site's site path. The site's site path is always
the site path given on the site card, regardless of how the company got to
that site.
Events can alter both a site's site path and a company's site path.

#### Skill Cards
Two or more skill cards may be played by a single character outside of the
strike sequence.
Two skill cards may not be declared by one character against a given
strike.
"\<Foo> only" cards can only be played by characters with the \<foo> skill.

#### Stage Resources
@ If your opponent is playing the same Fallen-wizard as you, and reveals
that Fallen-wizard first, you must discard any Fallen-wizard specific stage
resources that you have in play.
@ Wizard specific Stage Resources may be played with the starting company.

### -= TTT =-

#### Targets
An action that is played out through one or more specific entities as
stated on a card or in the rules is considered to "target" the entities. A
targeted entity is said to be a "target" of the action. A card that acts on a
class of entities does not target them.
Annotation 1: A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of
effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be
the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to
this is a dice-rolling action, e.g. a corruption check.
Annotation 2: A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted
in the chain of effects during which it was declared.
Annotation 3: Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets
because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they
generally affect an entire class of things.
Annotation 4: An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of
a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-
guard cards.
You cannot target an opponent's character or resources with your own
resources.
A card that is played on a card continuously targets the card it is on.
See also Rulings by Term, Active Condition.

#### Timing
The validity of an effect, including the hazard limit, is checked upon
declaration and upon resolution.
Annotation 24: If a card specifies that more than one action occurs when
the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all of these actions are to
be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order
listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple
actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared
in the reverse order as they are printed.
(amendment to original version of Annotation 24): As an exception, if one
of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the
attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the
strike sequence--see Annotation 18 (Turn Sequence, Movement/ Hazard Phase,
Combat, The Strike Sequence).
Annotation 27: If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card
must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is
played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is
resolved, if any active conditions for the choice of effects do not exist, the
card has no effect and is discarded. The player may not at this point choose
to implement an alternative effect of the card.

#### Trophies
Creatures whose marshalling points are listed with an * give marshalling
points while used as trophies.
Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies, including Dragon
factions.
Trophies can be discarded to satisfy "thieving" attacks, and count as items
for all other effects.

### -= UUU =-

#### Under-deeps
@ Marshalling points with companies at or moving from an Under-deeps site do
not count for the purposes of calling the Free Council. They do count at the
Council. This includes minion and Fallen-wizard companies.
When a company's site of origin is an Under-deeps site and the company
reveals a new site at the start of its movement/hazard phase, the company is
declaring it will make a roll to determine if the movement was successful. No
cards can be played between the site being revealed and the roll except for
Reach of Ulmo. Neither player draws cards for this movement if the roll is not
successful.
At an Under-deeps site, after a successful rescue attempt, a character can
tap for a minor item only.
Automatic-attacks that allow the revealing of creature cards are not
stopped by Stealth or Secret Entrance.
Creatures revealed as automatic-attacks do not count as creatures.

### -= WWW =-

#### Wizard
# You may put two of the same Wizard in your deck, or you may put one copy
each of two different Wizards in your deck.
  
#### Tournament Rulings
Tournament rulings are modifications and additions to the rules presented
in the Unlimited Edition rules book that are required for sanctioned Council
of Lorien tournament play.

#### General
Dice must be used to obtain random numbers.
There is a required 30 card minimum for both resources and hazards for
sanctioned tournament play.
All Ringwraith/Sauron players always have +5 unused general influence at
all times. This bonus general influence can never be used to control
characters.

#### The Character Draft
The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.
Each player reveals one character at a time from their pool, simultaneously
with their opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into the starting companies,
duplicated characters are put aside and not allowed in either starting
company. Each player continues until they want to stop, they have 20 points of
mind in their starting company, or they have five characters in their starting
company.
Ringwraith players may start with 6 characters in the character draft
If one player stops revealing characters, the other one may continue to
reveal characters.
No player may reveal a character that would bring his starting company's
total mind over 20.
When players are finished, each may put up to 10 characters into their
deck, including characters from his starting pool that did not end up in the
starting company.
Characters left over from the character pool may be placed either in the
play deck, or out of play, but may not be placed in the sideboard.

#### Deck Construction
Cards that can be played as either hazards or resources may count as either
for purposes of deck construction.
Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.
The following count as 1/2 a creature for deck construction: hazards that
can be played as creatures or events, At Home Dragon manifestations, Ahunt
Dragon manifestations, and agents. Note that agents count as characters in
Ringwraith decks, not as 1/2 creatures.
Up to 3 copies of one Wizard or Ringwraith is allowed in a play deck, or up
to 2 copies of one and 1 copy of another. One copy each of three different
Wizards or Ringwraiths is not allowed.
You may place Ringwraiths or Wizards in your sideboard, as long as only one
of them is duplicated in the deck and sideboard combined, and you have only
Ringwraiths or only Wizards in the deck and sideboard combined.
You may include hero items in a Ringwraith deck even in a Ringwraith vs.
Ringwraith game.

#### Great Secrets Buried There
If you play this card as a hazard on your opponent, you must be able to
provide your opponent with a copy of any uncommon Under-deeps sites if he does
not have a copy in his location deck.
If you give an Under-deeps site to your opponent, it will return to your
location deck when he is done with it, unless you have also used the site, in
which case it returns to your discard pile.

#### Movement
Maps of the regions of MECCG may be used in place of region cards in
Council of Lorien tournaments. If two or more companies move on the same turn,
then each company does not have to determine the site path to its new site
until the beginning of it's movement/hazard phase.
Wizard companies cannot use starter movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth.
If using region movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth, they must move from a
site in Imlad Morgul, through either Nurn or Udun, or use a movement enhancer
like Ash Mountains or Eagle-mounts. Such sites may be reached normally with
Under-deeps movement.

#### Starting Companies
Ringwraith/Sauron players may have starting companies at Dol Guldur and/or
Minas Morgul. A Ringwraith may also be brought into play at Dol Guldur, Minas
Morgul, or his home site.

#### Victory Conditions
Eliminating a Wizard or Ringwraith does not end the game. An eliminated
Wizard or Ringwraith is placed in the out-of-play pile, and gives -5 MP to
the final total. That player may not reveal another Wizard or Ringwraith.
This includes Wizards who fail corruption checks.

#### The Weakest Link Method
If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption point to each
non-Wizard in play. Each character then makes a corruption check and
marshalling points are recounted.
Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all non-Wizard
characters are corrupted away.
