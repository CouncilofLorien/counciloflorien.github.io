# OFFICIAL RULINGS

Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) published errata and clarifications to the rules and cards in the various _Companion_ and _Player Guide_ books and on their website in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Collected Rulings File (CRF). These rulings are _official_ in that they were authored or authorized by Coleman Charlton and Mike Reynolds, the Designers and Developers of _Middle-earth CCG_ at Iron Crown Enterprises. However, some of these rulings are _outdated_ as they were revised, clarified, or superceded over the course of the game. Even the final version of the CRF (version 15) includes outdated rulings as superceded rulings were not removed. 

The digital version of these official rulings correct minor typographical, grammatical, and formatting issues. The Complete & Final Rules present the rules with all official errata, clarifications, and other revisions.
