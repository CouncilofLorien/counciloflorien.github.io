Especially new and succulent information is marked with \*s. Thanks to Herve Guillemet for help on information gathering for this FAQ.

#### Questions About Characters

**Q**:  What is the difference between discarding a character and eliminating a character?  
**A**:  A discarded character can be brought into play again, either by yourself or another player.  An eliminated character may not be brought back into play at all.

**Q**:  Do you have to put two of the same wizard in your play deck or can you put two different wizards in your deck?  
**A**:  You can either put two of the same wizard in or two different wizards in.

**Q**:  Can characters with a bonus to influence against "Blue Mountain Dwarves" use that bonus against dwarf characters with the home site Blue Mountains?  
**A**:  No.  This bonus only applies to the Blue Mountain Dwarf faction.

**\*Q**:  If a character has a bonus to their direct influence do they get the bonus for each of their followers?  
**\*A**:  No. They only get the bonus once.

#### Questions About Combat

**Q**:  The rules say the modification for tapped is -1 and for wounded is -2.  If you are tapped and wounded is the modification -3?  
**A**:  No. Wounded characters are only at -2.

**Q**:  How do creatures with a body number work?  
**A**:  For each strike that is defeated, a body check must also be made. The body must be defeated for every strike in order to get MPs for the creature.

**\*Q**:  In what order are permanent bonuses applied?  
**\*A**:  In any order you want, but before combat modifiers.

**\*Q**:  How exactly are strikes assigned?  
**\*A**:  When you are facing a hazard creature, you may only assign strikes to untapped characters. You may only assign one strike to each character. Any strikes you do not assign your opponent may assign to any characters who have not yet been assigned a strike. Any strikes remaining after that may be assigned as -1 modifiers by your opponent.  More than one of these modifiers may be assigned to a single character.

**\*Q**:  When is it too late to cancel a strike or an attack?  
**\*A**:  Once the strikes have been assigned it is too late to cancel the attack. Once the dice have been rolled it is too late to cancel the strike.

**\*Q**:  Are the side effects of losing a character dealt with before or after I finish resolving any other strikes?  
**\*A**:  They are resolved immediately, before the other characters face their strikes.

#### Questions About Movement

**Q**:  How does starter movement work?  
**A**:  Each company will have a face up site card showing the site it is at. This is called the site of origin. By the end of the organization phase put a face down new site for each of your companies that wishes to move. If a company's site of origin is a non-haven site (not Rivendell, Lorien, Edhellond, or Grey Havens), the new site must be the nearest haven. If the site of origin is a haven site there are two options. If you want to go to another haven you may go to one of the two nearest havens listed on your site of origin card, the new site card would be one of these two havens. If you want to go to a non-haven site it must be one which lists the site of origin as the nearest haven. If the company successfully makes it to the new site, discard the site of origin at the end of the movement/hazard phase.

**Q**:  Does a company have to move each turn?  
**A**:  No. Simply play no new site card for a company that does not wish to move. This company is considered to be at its site of origin for your entire turn. Thus, your opponent may only play hazard creatures that are playable at the company's site. That is, hazard creatures with symbols that matches the site's symbol.

**Q**:  How does region movement work?  
**A**:  To move a company from its site of origin to another site using region movement, lay down a series of up to four regions and the new site by the end of your organization phase. Each region in the series must list on its card the regions that are connected with it in the series as adjacent regions. The region at the beginning of the series must be the region listed on the site of origin card. The region at the end of the series must be the region listed on the new site card. A site which lies more than four regions away from the site of origin may not be reached in one turn with region movement (without _Bridge_, _Shadowfax_, etc.).

**Q**:  Lebennin and Ithilien look adjacent on the map in the rulebook, but they aren't listed as adjacent on the cards. Is this a mistake?  
**A**:  No. If a site is not listed as adjacent on the card, it is not adjacent. In this case the Anduin River seperates the two regions.

**Q**:  Why would I want to use region movement?  
**A**:  Region movement allows you to move from one non-haven site to another non-haven site, which speeds up the game. It also allows greater flexibility in movement. The only disadvantage is that an opponent can play certain hazard creatures keyed to specific regions.

**Q**:  Why don't the starter decks have region cards?  
**A**:  A priority in the design of the game was to insure the playability of starter decks. Region cards would likely be mechanically useless cards in a starter deck game.

**\*Q**:  How exactly is the site path determined?  
**\*A**:  The site path is determined by the way you got to the site. If you used starter movement the site path is the path on the site card for moving to and from a haven, or the path on the haven card for moving from haven to haven. If you are using region movement the site path is made of the region types on the region card you played. The site path always include the site type of the site you move to.

#### Questions About Playing Hazards

**Q**:  Does the hazard limit change if a character is eliminated during the movement/hazard phase?  
**A**:  No. The hazard limit is set at the begining of movement.

**Q**:  Do permanent events count against the hazard limit?  
**A**:  Permanent events only count against the hazard limit when first played, unless they tap. In that case they count twice: once when played and once when tapped.

**\*Q**:  If my opponent has 2 companies when the first one moves can I play a hazard on the second one?  
**\*A**:  No. Hazards may only be played on a company that is moving. Note that long and permanent events may affect both companies even if they are played "on" the first company.

**\*Q**:  Can an on guard card be triggered by one company and affect another?  
**\*A**:  No.

**\*Q**:  If a card requires two wilderness in the site path do they need to be consecutive?  
**\*A**:  No.

#### Questions About the Site Phase 

**\*Q**:  The rules say you can play a minor item after successfully playing a resource at a site.  Can you do this even if minor items are not playable at the site?  
**\*A**:  Yes.

**\*Q**:  Once I get to a site how exactly do I go about exploring it?  
**\*A**:  First declare that you are exploring the site. Then face the automatic attack. If you have an untapped character at the site play a card that is playable at that site. For most items and information cards it will say on the site card if you can play an item of that type (minor, major, greater, gold ring). For some items, factions, and allies it will say on the resource card if it is playable at that site. If the resource is successfully played and you still have an untapped character you may play a minor item. If after facing the automatic attack you have no untapped characters you must wait until next turn and face the automatic attack again.

**\*Q**:  Can I use a card that cancels an attack to cancel an automatic attack?  
**\*A**:  Yes. This counts as facing the automatic attack.

#### Questions About Specific Cards

**\*Q**:  If Alatar uses his special ability to help a company, does he stay with that company?  
**\*A**:  Yes, he does.

**Q**:  If the _Balrog of Moria_ is in play and Galadriel gets killed, what happens in Lorien?  
**A**:  Though it makes little sense, the "In addition" section is not used because she is "out-of-play."

**\*Q**:  If I play the _Balrog_ and then kill it do I get the MP's?  
**\*A**:  No.

**Q**:  Does _Bane of the Ithil-stone_ stop me from drawing cards when someone moves?  
**A**:  No. It will only cancel actions that literally cause a player to search throught or look at any pertion of any play deck or discard pile outside the sequence of normal play. It will cancel _Vilya_, which allows Elrond's player to look through their discard pile and put 5 cards into their play deck; and it will cancel _Lucky Search_. _Bane of the Ithil-stone_ will not stop an effect which allows a player to bring cards from their sideboard into their discard pile or play deck. Neither will it affect an action which otherwise only causes a player to reshuffle their play deck.

**Q**:  If a character gets returned to your hand by _Call of Home_ or _Call of the Sea_, can you transfer all their items to other characters?  
**A**: No, you may transfer one item. All other non-follower cards controlled by the target character are discarded.

**Q**: Can I play a _Cave-drake_ at a Ruins & Lairs without two Wilderness in the site path?  
**A**: Sure, go for it.

**Q**: If you cancel the _Corpse-candle's_ attack does the company still have to make the corruption checks?  
**A**: No, they do not.

**\*Q:** Can you use an _Elven Cloak_ to cancel a hazard keyed to double wilderness?  
**\*A:** Yes.

**Q**: Does _Doors of Night_ cancel resource environments played after the _Doors of Night_ are played?  
**A**: No. _Doors of Night_ only cancels resource environments that are in play when the _Doors of Night_ are played. The same goes for _Gates of Morning_ cancelling hazard environments.

**\*Q:** Does the site have to be untapped in order to use the _Dwarven Ring of Barin's Tribe_?  
**\*A:** Yes.

**Q**: Does the character wounded by _Escape_ have to be unwounded when the _Escape_ is played?  
**A**: Yes. You cannot play _Escape_ on a wounded character.

**Q**: If _Doors of Night_ is in play does _Eye of Sauron_ give +3 or +4 to the prowess of each automatic attack?  
**A**: _Eye of Sauron_ will only give +3 to the prowes of each automatic attack.

**\*Q:** Do _Dwarven Rings_ give Dwarves +7 influence, or an influence of 7?  
**\*A:** They give +7 to direct influence.

**\*Q:** Whose body is refered to on Eowyn and many of the other female cards, hers or the Nazgul's?  
**\*A:** The Nazgul's.

**\*Q:** Can I play more than one _Fellowship_ on a company?  
**\*A:** Yes.

**Q**: If I stay at an untapped site during my movement and play a _Foul Fumes_ during my opponent's movement, does my site tap?  
**A**: No. This is because the site path when you do not move consists of only the site type.

**Q**: What happens to a Gold Ring card when I test it?  
**A**: It is discarded, and you loose the Marshalling Point it gave you. If you have the right ring (as indicated by the test roll) in your hand you may play it immediately.

**Q**: Can _Gollum_ and _The One Ring_ ever be together at the same site?  
**A**: Yes. The text on _Gollum_ is an ability that you can choose to use, not an effect that happens automatically.

**Q**: When _Great Road_ is played does the opponent *have* to draw twice the number of cards normally drawn?  
**A**: No, they may choose to draw less. Consider _Great Road_ to have errata that changes "Opponent draws twice..." to "Opponent may draw up to twice."

**Q**: Are there any other cards with errata?  
**A**: Yes. The following cards all have errata:

 - _Akhorahil_: Change "...gives -1 penalty to one..." to "...gives a +1 penalty to one..."
 - _Dwarven Ring of Bavor's Tribe_: one "reshuffle the play deck" is sufficient.
 - _Dwarven Ring of Druin's Tribe_: one "reshuffle the play deck" is sufficient.
 - _Dwarven Ring of Thelor's Tribe_: Values in parenthesis and brackets apply to Dwarf bearer. The prowess/body modifications should read: "+2(4)/+1."
 - _Dwarven Ring of Thrar's Tribe_: Values in parenthesis and brackets apply to Dwarf bearer. The prowess/body modifications should read: "+2(4)/+1."
 - _Ent-draughts_: Remove "as a minor item" and replace with "and only if an ally or faction has been succesfully played at Wellinghall."
 - _The Great Goblin_: "Unique. Orc. One strike..."
 - _Gwaihir_: Should read "...you may discard Gwaihir during the Organization phase to allow his company..."
 - _Horses_: Add "Playable only at the end of the Organization phase."
 - _Morannon_: Should read "This card is used as a Dark-hold (D) site card in the region of Udun that is moved to..."
 - \*_Neeker Breekers_: Add "Does not affect Wizards."
 - _Roac the Raven_: Remove "-no modifications to the influence check are required."  Replace with "-treat this influence check as though it were made by a Diplomat."
 - _Seige_: Change the border-land symbol in the first line to a border-hold symbol.
 - _Shadowfax_: "...an additional site card may be played and an additional movement/hazard phase..."
 - _Silent Watcher_: Gives 1 marshalling point, not 0.
 - _Slayer_: Gives 2 marshalling point, not 0
 - _Traitor_: Remove the last paragraph.
 - _Twilight_: This card may be played at any time during any player's turn.
 - _Wizard's Laughter_: Change "Wizard only." to "Wizard only during opponent's site phase."
 - _Wolves_: Change "Animals." to "Wolves."

**Q**: What do _Great Ship_, _Leaflock_, and _Tom Bombadil_ mean when they say "cancel the effects of one hazard"?  
**A**: These cards allow the cancelling of an attack. They also allow the cancelling of an ongoing hazard effect that targets the company in question or any entity associated with that company (item, character, site, etc.). They allow the cancelling of a dice-rolling action declared earlier in the same chain of effects but not yet resolved (as in _Call of Home_). They do not allow the cancelling of a non-dice-rolling effect declared earlier in the same chain of effects. For example, they do not allow you to stop "_Tom_" from forcing a wounded player to discard their item if you passed on the opportunity to cancel "_Tom's_" attack. However, once a chain of effects has resolved _Leaflock_ and the others allow the cancelling of an effect of an effect that is ongoing. For example, _Leaflock_ cound stop the effect of _River_, but he could not keep _Adunaphel_ from tapping a character as a short-event.

**\*Q:** If _Doors of Night_ is in play, Long Winter only taps the sites belonging to the player whose turn it is, right?  
**\*A:** Wrong. _\*All\*_ sites in play with two Wildernesses in their site path become tapped.

**Q**: Can I play _Lucky Search_ at a tapped site?  
**A**: Sure, go ahead. It can be played at a tapped or untapped site.

**\*Q:** If I get a second resource with _Lucky Search_ can I play a second minor item too?  
**\*A:** No.

**Q**: If I play a ring special item after testing a gold ring, will this trigger a corruption check for _Lure of Expedience_?  
**A**: Yes, it will trigger a corruption check.

**\*Q:** If I tap a character to help another character with a _Lure of the Sense's_ corruption check, do they then untap?  
**\*A:** No, they will not untap until next turn.

**Q**: What exactly does the "Only playable at Lorien" mean on _Mirror of Galadriel_?  
**A**: It means that _Mirror of Galadriel_ is playable if any of your characters is at Lorien.

**Q**: When do I have to declare using the _Morgul-horse_ to bring a Nazgul permanent-event back into my hand?  
**A**: You must declare this during the same turn, but before, the target Nazgul permanent-event is tapped.

**Q**: Do I have to discard my _Morgul Night_ if _Doors of Night_ is discarded?  
**A**: No, Doors of Night is only required when _Morgul Night_ comes into play.

**Q**: What happens to Nazgul events cancelled using _Praise to Elbereth_?  
**A**: They are discarded and have no effect. Also note that when _Praise to Elbereth_ is played, you must declare which characters are tapping to cancel which Nazgul events.

**Q**: What happens if I use the _Palantir of Orthanc_ to get a site card from my discard deck?  
**A**: This is actually an invalid use of the card. You can't use it to get site cards because they don't belong in your play deck.

**Q**: When does a wounded character recieve the corruption from _The Pale Sword_?  
**A**: Immediately following the Nazgul's attack. The same is true for the _Morgul-knife_.

**Q**: Who chooses the character to make the corruption check when _The Precious_ is played?  
**A**: The player playing _The Precious_ chooses.

**Q**: If I tap _Ren the Unclean_ on my opponent's turn, can I play resources to modify the corruption checks of my characters?  
**A**: No you may not. If you are playing standard rules your characters can tap to give +1 to another character's check in the same company.

**\*Q:** I can tap Saruman to use an un-aligned palantir, right?  
**\*A:** Right.

**Q**: Can _Shadowfax_ carry allies?  
**A**: No. To be elligible for _Shadowfax's_ special ability the party can contain no allies.

**\*Q:** When does _Siege_ go away?  
**\*A:** When all copies of the site it is played on are removed.

**\*Q:** Can I tap the target of _Slayer_ to cancel one of the attacks?  
**\*A:** No.

**Q**: Does Thorin II get a total +4 direct influece against _Blue Mountain Dwarves_?  
**A**: Yes, he does.

**\*Q:** Can I play _Tookish Blood_ on a character who just failed a corruption check?  
**\*A:** The discarding of the character happens immediately after the failed roll. There is no time for any effects to be used.

**Q**: Can I play _Twilight_ on a card that has not resolved yet?  
**A**: Yes, _Twilight_ may target a card played earlier in the same chain of effects.

**Q**: Can I play _Twilight_ as a resource during my opponent's turn?  
**A**: Yes. If you do so _Twilight_ does not count against the hazard limit for that company.

#### Questions About Timing

**\*Q:** When is the validity of an effect checked?  
**\*A:** Upon resolution.

#### Miscellaneous Questions

**\*Q:** A hobbit is facing an automatic attack because he burgled a site. Can my other characters tap to aid him in facing the attack?  
**\*A:** Yes. Burgling hobbits must face the attack themselves, but can be aided by any other company members that can participate in the attack.

**\*Q:** During the Free Council can I tap characters to give +1 to a corruption check?  
**\*A:** Yes, but note that the player calling the free council does not get an untap phase.
