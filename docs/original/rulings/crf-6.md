# Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game

Collected Official Rulings File
{: .text-center .text-beta}

Version 6 current as of July 10th, 1997.
{: .text-center }

If playing in a tournament, be sure to check Section III: Tournament
Rulings first, as some of them differ from the rulings for casual play.
Otherwise, be sure to check all factors involved with your ruling
question; including any relevant turn sequence, term, or card.

These are clarifications to the rules for the _Middle-earth:
Collectible Card Game_, except where noted as errata. Unless otherwise
stated, they assume you are playing the one-deck standard game.
This rulings file will be updated every now and then. Items marked
with a @ are either new, changed, or certified free of editor
infestations for the latest update.

The Annotations from the _Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion_ have now
been integrated into the rulings. They are denoted as annotations and
retain their original numbering as given in the Companion. Note that
Annotations 11 and 24 have been modified from what is printed in the
Companion.

The official netrep, rules archivist, and Crossing-guard of Mordor is

The official website's hurl is http://www.ironcrown.com. Middle-
earth rulings are also on Ichabod's website at

&emsp;[III. Rulings by Term]()

&emsp;[IV. Tournament Rulings]()

&emsp;[V. Card Errata and Rulings]()

## II. TURN SEQUENCE

### A. Begining of the Game

If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in the starting
company, then it does not count against the 10 character limit.

Either draw numbers for the whole game or roll dice for the whole
game.

### B. Untap Phase

Corruption checks triggered at the end of this phase happen after
everyone untaps. Characters that tap to aid the check will not untap
until their next untap phase.

You may do things besides untap during this phase.

### C. Organization Phase

#### Choosing a New Site

Rules Erratum: When a company splits any of the resulting companies
can move with region movement. Region movement is not limited to one
company of a split.

Region cards are not unique. However, any single site path cannot
have more than one copy of a particular region.

Any company may declare as its new site a site already on the table.
That site will remain on the table at least until the end of that
company's movement/hazard phase.

Two companies may not start at the same site and move to the same new
site.

#### Followers

A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence against "Blue
Mountain Dwarves" to control characters with the home site Blue Mountain
Dwarf-hold.

Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only once, not
for each character.

#### Organizing Companies

If a company splits up, their player chooses which characters are the
original company and which characters are a new company, unless
otherwise directed by a card. All resource permanent-events played on
the original company stay with the original company.

Company composition changes, including bringing a character into
play, must all be done at the same time during the organization phase.
During this time no other actions may be taken.

#### Playing Characters

Rules Erratum: You may play a character if you do not have enough
influence to control them. However, if there are any characters you do
not have the influence to control at the end of your organization phase,
the character you brought into play this turn must be returned to your
hand.

You may play a character under general influence at their home site
without a company at that site. The one exception to this is if you are
playing Standard Game and your Wizard has been revealed. In that case
your Wizard must be present to bring a character into play under general
influence.

Hobbits may only be brought into play at Bag End, not at Havens.

#### Storing Items

@ Minions who roll equal to or one less than their accumulated
corruption when storing an item are only tapped.

### D. Long Event Phase

### E. Movement/Hazard Phase

#### General

Annotation 25: A company is considered to be at the site given by its
site card at all times except from the moment their new site card is
revealed during their movement/hazard phase until their old site card is
discarded during the same movement/hazard phase. During this period a
company is considered to be en route between sites and not at any site.

Annotation 26: If at the start of a movement/hazard phase there are
multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order
they are applied, the player who is currently not taking his turn
decides the order in which they are to be applied. Once this
interpretation is established, all further actions are applied in the
order they are resolved for the rest of the turn.

Once the effects of an environment card have been applied to a target
during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again
to that target during the current turn.

A company is not considered to be at its new site until the end of
the company's site of origin is removed. A company is only considered
to be moving during its movement/hazard phase, and only if it plays a
new site card.

Resource cards cannot be played between the movement/hazard phases of
two different companies.

You do not have to decide how many cards you want to draw before you
start to draw them.

Companies at the same non-haven/non-darkhaven site must join at the
end of all movement/hazard phases, before the site phase starts.

Companies at the same haven/darkhaven site may join at this time.

If companies would join at the end of the movement/hazard phase such
that the company composition rules are violated, one company of the
hazard playerÄ…s choice must return to its site of origin.

If two companies join at a site, cards affecting one of the companies
now affect them both.

A company's movement/hazard phase is concluded when both players
agree to reconcile their hand sizes. No actions may be taken until the
site phase or until both players have drawn cards for the movement of a
following company.

#### Combat

Strikes are assigned in the following manner: First the defending
player assigns strikes to his untapped characters; Second the attacking
player assigns the remaining strikes; Third the attacking player may
assign extra strikes as -1 modifiers to characters' prowess. Each
character must be assigned one strike before any character gets an extra
strike. The extra strikes are not assigned to a character until that
character's strike is resolved.

Cancelling an attack does not defeat it.

A creature cannot be canceled based on region type if that creature
was played keyed to a region by name.

Side effects of losing a character are resolved immediately after the
character is lost, before other characters resolve their strikes.

If a creature has a body, each strike is only defeated if the body is
defeated for that strike.

If an attack states all characters in a company face a strike, then
effects which allow a character to face more than one strike have no
effect against the attack. Similarly, effects that change the attack's
number of strikes have no effect. As an exception, effects which reduce
the number of strikes to a specific number do work.

#### The Strike Sequence

The strike sequence is a period of time that begins when a player
announces one of his characters will resolve a strike. It ends after the
strike dice-roll or strike cancellation, and any body checks resulting
from that strike.

Annotation 16: When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is
considered in his history to have been wounded and must face any special
actions the wounding strike presented him.

Annotation 17: The only actions that may be declared during a strike
sequence are those outlined in Annotation 18.

Annotation 18: When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike
against a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by
either player until the strike dice-roll is made are the following: play
hazard cards that affect the strike, the attacker may decide to use any
or all of his remaining -1 modifications due to strikes in excess of the
company's size, a target untapped character may take a -3 modification
so that he will not automatically tap, and the defending character may
play resource cards that affect the strike. An action that has the
condition that a target character tap, but which otherwise has an effect
not outlined here, may not be declared at this point. This is true even
if the recipient of the strike would be the target character tapping and
thus recieve -1 to his prowess.

Annotation 19: Following each successful strike or failed strike, a
body check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body).
However, if the strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g.,
a character wounded by "William" may be required to discard his items),
these special actions are resolved before the body check. The body check
is the first declared action in a nested chain of effects that
immediately follows the strike dice-roll and special actions resulting
from the strike. Other actions may be declared in response to a body
check, in the same chain of effects, but these are limited to those
actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. E.g., Tookish
Blood could not be declared in response to the body check caused by
Giant Spiders wounding a Hobbit. No action may be declared in response
to a special action resulting from a strike unless the special action is
a dice-rolling action, i.e., a special action is generally considered
synonymous with the strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling 
action, an action may be declared in response to it if the
action directly affects the dice-roll.

Annotation 20: If more than one special action is to follow a strike,
the defending player decides the order they are resolved.

Annotation 21: A successful strike against a character is synonymous
with that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on
the playing surface is not a seperate action from the successful strike.
Cancelling a strike does not defeat it.

A strike is only defeated if the body of the strike is defeated.

Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general, wounded
charcters are not considered tapped.

Prowess modifications from items come first. Then other bonuses are
applied in the order the player controlling the character decides. Even
a bonus given on a character's card is applied after item bonuses.

#### Movement

Starter movement works as follows: Each company will have a face up
site card showing where it is. This is called the site of origin. By
the end of the organization phase put a face down new site for each of
your companies that you wish to move. If a company's site of origin is a
non-Haven site, the new site must be the nearest Haven. If the site of
origin is a Haven site there are two options. If you want to go to
another Haven you may go to one of the two nearest Havens listed on your
site of origin card, the new site card would be one of these two Havens.
If you want to go to a non-Haven site it must be one which lists the
site of origin as the nearest Haven. If the company successfully makes
it to the new site, discard the site of origin at the end of that
company's movement/hazard phase. For a minion company, replace Haven
with Dark Haven in the above paragraph.

Region movement works as follows: To move a company from its site of
origin to another site using region movement, lay down a series of up to
four regions and the new site by the end of your organization phase.
Each region in the series must list on its card the regions that are
connected with it in the series as adjacent regions. The region at the
beginning of the series must be the region listed on the site of origin
card. The region at the end of the series must be the region listed on
the new site card. A site which lies more than four regions away from
the site of origin may not normally be reached in one turn with region
movement.

Region movement can be used to move from one non-Haven/non-Dark Haven
site to another non-Haven/non-Dark Haven site.

A company does not have to move each turn. If a company does not move
it still has a movement/hazard phase. No cards are drawn for the company
and the only hazards that can be played on the company are creatures
that can be keyed to the company's site and events.

Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they look that
way on some maps.

#### Playing Hazards

The hazard limit does not change if a character is eliminated or
discarded during the movement/hazard phase.

Hazard permanent-events count against the hazard limit. Some hazard
permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an effect, and
this counts against the hazard limit unless specified otherwise on the
card.

Hazards may only be played on a company whose movement/hazard phase
is being resolved. Long-events and permanent-events may effect more than
one company even though they are only played "on" one company.

If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a region type,
those region types do not have to be consecutive in the site path.

If a creature hazard resolves and there are no longer any instances
of the region or site it was keyed to, then the creature is immediately
discarded for no effect on play. If any instances of the region or site
it was keyed to are in the site path when the creature resolves then the
creature takes effect, even if those instances are not the ones that
were there when the creature was declared.

If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent plays a
resource before the movement/hazard phase ends, you may then continue
playing hazards, assuming you have not yet reached the hazard limit.

A creature that can be played in a specific region by name can be
played on a company using starter movement if that company's site of
origin or site of destination are in that specific region.

If a company is moving from a surface site to an Under-deeps site,
hazards may not be played keyed to the region of the surface site.

Angmar Arises, In Darkness Bind Them, and Reaching Shadow may not be
used to play creatures keyed to double shadow-lands.

#### Returning to Site of Origin

If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path immediately
disappears.

An effect that returns a company to its site of origin may not be
declared in the middle of an attack.

## F. Site Phase

#### General

The Golden Rule: in order to play any card or take any action during
the site phase, the site must be entered. This means facing any
automatic-attacks, even if you have entered the site on a previous turn.

The Golden Rule, Part II: A resource does not have to be played
during the site phase unless the card says so; or unless the card is an
item, faction or ally.

The Golden Rule, Part III: There is no one resource card per site
phase rule. The only requirements for playing such a resource are that
the site be untapped and that you faced any automatic-attacks at the
start of the site phase. If you can find a way to untap the site or play
a resource at a tapped site, you can play more than one resource per
site phase.

#### Company vs. Company Combat

The defender may take actions that affect the attack or any of the
strikes. The attacker may only take actions that affect individual
strikes.

True Fana and Sacrifice of Form cannot be used in company versus
company combat.

#### Exploring A Site/Automatic-attacks

To explore a site, first declare you are exploring the site. Then
face any automatic-attacks at the site, and any on-guard hazard
creatures or agents revealed. If you have any untapped characters; you
may then tap one to play an item, information, ally or faction card. For
most items and information cards the site will say if they are playable
at that site. Special items, and factions and allies, say on the
resource card at which sites they are playable.

A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an automatic-attack, and
this counts as facing the automatic-attack.

The automatic-attack is not a hazard, nor is it a creature.

Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the normal
automatic-attacks for the site. Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in
the order listed and/or resolved.

@ Company composition and overt/covert status is checked before each
automatic attack

#### Influence Attempts

It is not possible to influence an item away from a Wizard or
Ringwraith.

You must enter a site to make an influence attempt.

You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.

A successful influence attempt on an opponent's resource does not tap
the site.

#### On-Guard Cards

Rules Erratum: An on-guard may only be revealed if it could have also
been played during the movement/hazard phase. This means all targets of
the card must have existed during the movement/hazard phase in order for
the card to be revealed.

A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as though it were
both declared and resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects
during which it was revealed.

There are two cases when a face down on-guard card may be revealed:

 1. When the company announces it will face a site's automatic-attack, but before the automatic-attack is itself faced. The site must have an automatic-attack to reveal the card now. The card must either modify the automatic-attack or be a creature hazard keyable to the site.
 2. When the company plays resource that potentially taps the site. The card must affect the company or a character in the company that site
phase. Note that this clarification is looser than the rule printed on p.61 of the Unlimited Rulesbook

A creature revealed as an on-guard card is considered a hazard
creature attack, not an automatic-attack.

A successful ring test does not allow an on-guard card to be
revealed.

You may reveal a card in response to an influence attempt against a
faction even if the on-guard card only has an effect if the attempt is
successful. You may also reveal a card in response to such an attempt
that affects the actual influence attempt.

Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be considered when
determining the validy of revealing an on-guard card. Cards in your
hand, your opponent's hand, play deck, discard pile, etc. cannot be
considered and potential effects that have not been triggered cannot be
considered.

A corruption card can be revealed as an on-guard card, so long as it
otherwise is legal, because a character in the company is affected.

A card that changes the company's site type cannot be revealed unless
this has some obvious effect on the company that site phase.

A card cannot be revealed that returns a company to its site of
origin.

A card cannot be revealed that taps a company's site.

A card cannot be revealed that potentially removes a character from a
company.

A card cannot be revealed that forces a company to do nothing during
its site phase.

A card that potentially removes an ally from the company can be
revealed, so long as it otherwise is legal.

A card may not be revealed that taps a character in the company.

Some long- and permanent-events can be revealed on-guard and effect
multiple companies.

You may play two on-guard hazards on the same site only if two
companies are moving to the same site.

The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's hand.

### G. End-of-Turn Phase

End-of-Turn effects are triggered by the ending of the End of Turn
phase. Once both players are done with all actions in the End of Turn
phase, all End of Turn effects are declared and resolved in the order
chosen by the current player.

Cards may be played during the End-of-Turn phase after hand size has
been reconciled.

### H. Free Council

If you have 0 marshalling points in characters, items, factions, or
allies then your opponent's points for that type are doubled. This
includes if you are brought down to 0 points in a category due to
negative marshalling points.

Characters may tap to aid corruption checks. Note that the player
calling the Free Council does not get an untap phase before it.

Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have an effect.

Only resources that directly affect corruption checks may be played
during the Free Council.

## III. Rulings By Term

#### Actions

@ Tapping a resource can only be done at a time when you could
otherwise play a resource event.

#### Active Conditions

An active condition must be in play or established when the action
requiring it is declared. Active conditions serve as the price of an
action. They are restrictions on the player invoking the action.

Annotation 5: If an action requires an entitiy to tap as a condition
for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the
action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity
at this point; this is considered synonymous with the action's
declarartion, i.e., it is not a seperate action. When it comes time to
resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in
play and tapped or the action is cancelled.

Annotation 6: If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a
condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded
when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the
action's declaration, i.e., it is not a seperate action.

Annotation 7: If any other active condition for an action does not
exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the
action were playing a card from your hand, it is discarded.

Annotation 8: An action that requires a target is considered to have
the active condition that the target be in play when the action is
declared and when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its
target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be
targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects.

When a card mentions an alternate use, the active conditions given in
the begining of the card text need only be met if they are also
mentioned by the alternate use.

Your opponent's resources may be the active conditions for your
resources, but may not be the targets for your resources.

#### Agent

Rules Erratum: A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move
from tapped status to utapped status).

Rules Erratum: An agent may tap to play creatures at a site if the
company is moving to the site.

Agents cannot attack or influence each other.

A tapped agent can move. Tapping is not condition of agent movement,
it is an effect of agent movement.

An influence attempt by an agent does not count against the hazard
limit in and of itself. Nor does it count as an agent action. Playing a
hazard event that allows an agent to make an influence attempt does
count against the hazard limit.

Playing a card that makes an agent attack is considered the attack's
declaration. Thus, if an agent is face down when Cunning Foes is played
on him, he receives all the face down bonuses.

Agents are *not* creatures.

Agents do not face attacks when moving.

Rolls made by agents during combat are done simultaneously with rolls
made by characters during combat, after step 4 of the strike sequence.

Agents revealed at Under-deeps are discarded without effect.

Agents may not be attacked by companies.

Only face-up agents are considered for uniqueness.

While in play agents played as hazards may not become minion
characters, and agents played as minion characters may not become
hazards.

An agent in a Ringwraith deck can only be played as a character at
his home site.

Agents may not be in a minion starting company.

When constructing a Ringwraith deck, agents are always considered
characters.

@ To wound an agent you only need to defeat the prowess of one strike.

To eliminate one you must defeat the prowess and body for all strikes.

@ Revealed agents may return to their homesite, even if they are at
one of their homesites.

@ Cards played on an agent remain face up when the agent turns face
down.

#### Ahunt Manifestations

If one Ahunt is out and you move through four of the regions listed
on it, then you face the attack once.

If four Ahunts are out an you move through one region listed on all
four, then you face each of the four attacks once.

Ahunt manifestations of unique Dragons are not considered creatures
for cards that affect the playing of a creature hazards, since Ahunt
manifestations are not played as creatures. An attack caused by an Ahunt
manifestation is considered to be from a hazard creature for cards that
affect hazard creatures already in play.

#### Ally

An ally can play any non-item resource that requires a specific
skill.

Allies cannot bear items.

Allies cannot tap to support corruption checks.

Allies may tap to cancel attacks from Slayers and Assassins.

Allies never make corruption checks.

Ent allies can be attacked by rescue attacks.

Allies cannot be targetted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot
be taken prisoner.

Allies that may not be attacked by certain attacks may still tap to
give +1 prowess to characters facing auch attacks, but no player may
assign strikes from such attacks to that ally.

Allies can be controlled by followers.

You do not need to spend influence to control an ally.

Allies cannot be passed from one player to another.

@ Playing an ally is not an influence attempt.

If an ally's controller leaves play for any reason, that ally is
discarded.

#### Attack

Annotation 12: An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded
when the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final
strike, and the associated body check are resolved.

Annotation 13: An attack may not be cancelled once its strikes have
been assigned. A strike may not be cancelled once the dice-roll for the
strike has been made.

Annotation 14: A cancelled attack has no effect on its target
company, except that the company is considered in its history to have
faced the attack.

Annotation 15: An attack must be the first declared action in a chain
of effects, i.e., a creatue card may not be played in response to
another card in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard
creature is an exception.

In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an attack, the
character doing so must be in the company facing the attack. Note that
the region/site type a hazard creature is keyed to (when declared) can
be affected otherwise.

Cards only modify attacks if they say they do. So Sun will not
modify an Assassin.

@ When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the MPs, the
creature goes to the out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played
the attack.

@ Excess strikes applied as -1 modifiers do not have to have their
body defeated

#### Burglary Attempts

After a succesful burglary attempt, another character may tap to play
a minor item.

May not be used to pick up Ally or Information cards.

The character who fails the burglary roll must face the automatic-
attack as though he were a one-character company. He can receive no
combat support other than what he himself can provide. This is a
reversal of an earlier ruling.

On-guard creatures are faced after a Burglaring attempt regardless of
the success of the attempt.

#### Body Check

Annotation 22: When a character fails a body check, his items may be
immediately reassigned to unwounded character in his company.

Reassigning of the eliminate character's items is considered to be
synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place
between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are
discarded.

Effects that modify a character's body also modify the number an Orc
or Troll would be discarded on. A maximum to body applies equally to the
discard number.

If an Orc or Troll character is discarded by the results of a body
check, all cards played with the character are also discarded.

@ If an Orc or Troll could be discarded and eliminated by a result,
discard them instead of eliminating them.

#### Cannot be Duplicated

Short-events that cannot be duplicated cannot be played if a card of
the same name is currently having an effect on play.

Annotation 11 (modified from its original version): Some cards cannot
be duplicated in limited cases -- generally on a specific target.

Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally,
so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be
duplicated can be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy
in play is currently being targetted by an effect that will discard it.

#### Card Effect Limitations

You may not play the following cards if your opponent is a Ringwraith
or Sauron. Additionally, if you are not a Ringwraith or Sauron, a
Ringwraith or Sauron opponent can play these cards against you and not
be affected by any of their global effects.

- All hazard events that require an agent\*
- Bane of the Ithil-stone
- The Black Enemy's Wrath
- Foul Fumes
- In the Heart of His Realm
- Mordor in Arms
- MÃ»mak
- Worn and Famished

\*Near to Hear a Whisper from Middle-earth: Against the Shadow and
Great Need or Purpose may be played because they do not target a
specific agent.

The following cards are also listed in the MELE Rulesbook as having
no effect on a Ringwraith/Sauron player, but this interpretation has
been modified.

Chance of Being Lost and Winds of Wrath: You may play these cards
against any opponent who is using the same type of location deck (hero
sites or minion sites) as yourself.

Great Secrets Buried There: This card may be played against a
Ringwraith or Sauron player one month after the release of Middle-earth:
Against the Shadow.

The Nazgul are Abroad: This card may be played against a Ringwraith
or Sauron player. The only restriction is that the first two paragraphs
are ignored when you play Nazgul creatures against a Ringwraith or
Sauron opponent. Any player can recycle Nazgul hazards as stated on the
card.

#### Character

You may continue to play after you have lost all of your characters.

A character enacting an effect counts as a character in his company.

A character in play must always be in one of three independent
states: untapped, tapped, or wounded.

#### Company

If all characters in a company are removed from the company, all
resource permanent-events played on the company as a whole are
discarded.

#### Corruption

Annotation 23: When a character fails a corruption check, the
standard effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or
eliminated and his items being discarded) are implemented immediately
and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the
corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g.
The Precious), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards,
e.g., Traitor, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an
action that results from the passive condition of a failed check, take
effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately
following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check.

Characters with 0 corruption points must still make corruption
checks.

A character may attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping.
The roll is at -3. A corruption card may only be attempted to be removed
once per turn if the tapping requirement is ignored.

You can not attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping if
you have attempted to remove that card already this turn.

The resolution of a character tapping to give +1 to a corruption
check happens when the corruption check itself resolves.

If an effect is in play that prevents a character from being
discarded, the character is not considered to fail his corruption check
if a result is achieved that would discard him. A Wizard would not be
eliminated and his player would not lose the game.

#### Darkhaven

Whenever an effect targeting a hero refers to Darkhavens, interpret
it as refering to Havens instead.

#### Detainment Attacks

Automatic-attacks are not detainment attacks unless specifically
stated on the site card.

@ Automatic-attacks are not detainment attacks unless specifically
stated to be such on the site card.

@ When a strike from a detainment attack succeeds, the character who
was facing that particular strike must tap.

@ Detainment attacks cannot be defeated.

@ Detainment attacks that would force item discards normally do not
force discards while they are detainment attacks.

@ Only cards that say they are detainment vs. hero companies are
detainment vs. hero companies.

#### Discard

A discarded character may be brought into play again by any player.

When a card is discarded, so are all permanent-events on that card.

Cards discarded from a player's hand must be discarded one at a time
as seperate actions.

Whenever a character is discarded, all non-follower cards played with
that character are also discarded.

#### DÃºnadan

DÃºnadan do not count as Men.

#### Eliminated

An eliminated character may not be played by any player for the rest
of the game.

When a card is eliminated, all permanent-events on that card are
discarded.

#### Exhausted

Permanent-events discarded when the play deck is exhausted are
shuffled into the new play deck along with the rest of the discard pile.

The play deck is exhausted when the last card is drawn.

#### Factions

The site does not tap unless the faction is succesfully played.

#### Gold Ring Item

When a gold ring item is tested, the ring is discarded and its
marshalling points are lost whether or not you are able to play a
special item.

@ Ring tests may have a result of less than two, given sufficient
negative modifiers.

@ Ring special items played as a result of storing a ring at a Dark
Haven will come into play stored.

#### Hand Size

Effects which increase your hand size or allow you to hold one more
card in your hand mean you draw up to your new hand size or discard down
to it at the appropriate points during the game. This supercedes the
normal requirement of drawing up to or discarding down to 8 cards.

#### Haven

Havens can tap, but Havens are always returned to the location deck
and not the discard pile.

Whenever an effect targetting a minion refers to a Haven, interpret
as a Darkhaven instead.

#### Hobbits

Hobbit characters may only be brought into play at Havens if it is
the start of the game and they are your starting characters. If a Hobbit
is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be brought
back into play normally at Bag End.

#### Influence

Restricted direct influence is limited in its use, usually to
characters and/or factions of specific races. Unrestricted direct
influence has no restrictions on its use.

When a character suffers a minus to direct influence, it must come
from unrestricted direct influence first. If there is no unrestricted
influence and there are multiple instances of restricted direct
influence, the player may choose which restricted direct influence the
minus is applied to.

@ If a card reduces direct influence, making it illegal for a follower
to be controlled, the follower does need to be controlled until their
next organization phase.

@ A character removed from the control of direct influence outside the
organization phase does not need to be controlled by general influence
until their next organization phase.

#### Items

You may play two weapons, shields, or armors on the same character
but only one of each may have an effect on the character.

You may play a minor item after succesfully playing a resource that
taps the site even if minor items are not playable at that site.

The "free" minor item may only be played immediately after playing
the resource that taps that site.

#### Keyed

Only attacks from hazard creatures are considered keyed.

#### Marshalling Point Pile

Under standard rules, no more than half of your marshalling points
can come from any one type of marshalling point. Do not round up.

@ You may not target hazards in your opponent's marshalling point pile
for removal.

#### May not Untap

Nothing may untap a character who is the subject of an effect that
states the character may not untap.

#### MELE vs. METW

Hero items may not be used as active condtions for minion resources,
and minion items may not be used as passive conditions for hero
resources.

If you are playing against a deck with three Wizards in it, you may
play three Ringwraiths. You may play with two of one Ringwraith and one
of another, or with three of one Ringwraith. You may not play with one
each of three different Ringwraiths.

Hero characters may now cancel automatic-attacks at their homesite,
regardless of their opponent.

You may not have both the minion and hero version of a unique item in
your deck.

#### Minion characters

Minion characters are not affected by cards that target agents.

#### Multi-player Games

Only the player to the left of the moving player may take advantage
of drawing cards, including cards drawn for events like The Nazgul are
Abroad and From the Pits of Angbad.

Only the hazard player and the moving player may play Twilight unless
a third playerÂ¹s card is affected by an environment card.

All players reset their hand size when any turn or movement/hazard
phase ends.

In multi-player games the following hazards count as 1/2 a creature:
hazards that can be played as events or creatures, Ahunt Dragon
manifestations, and At Home Dragon manifestations. Agents in a Wizard
deck also count as 1/2 creatures.

@ You may only play The Lidless Eye if none of your opponents are
Ringwraiths.

@ Twilight may only be played by the moving player and the hazard
player. As an exception, a player who's own enviroment will be
discarded by an environment may play Twilight to cancel that
environment.

#### Nazgul

If a NazgÃ»l is tapped to become a short-event as printed on its card,
it turns into a short-event upon declaration. At this point, the Nazgul
is a short-event just as if had been played as such from your hand.
The body refered to in the text of female characters with combat
bonuses against Nazgul is the body of the Nazgul

#### Optional Rules

If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the
character, the second strike is considered succesful.

A character tapping to face two strikes is at -3 prowess against both
strikes. The character taps when resolving the second strike.

For recently visited sites in multi-player games, the automatic-
attack gets +1 for each player who has that site in their discard pile.

#### Passive Conditions

A passive condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card
already in play.

Annotation 9: If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a
result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes
automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to
immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition.
The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved
in its own chain of effects, or the action is cancelled. Note that
actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules.

Annotation 10: If more than one action is required to be the first
action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is
chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be
declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions
have been declared.

A card causing an action as a result of a passive condition must be
in play when the action resolves, or else the action is cancelled.

@ When something would be discarded by a passive condition, that
discard is considered simultaneous with the resolution of the the
passive condition.

#### Ringwraiths

You may have any number of Ringwraiths in your sideboard, as long as
you do not duplicate more than one of them in the combined deck and
sideboard.

Ringwraiths may not use region movement. Ringwraiths may only move to
a non-Darkhaven site if they are in a mode (Fell Rider, Black Rider, or
Heralded Lord).

In general, effects that affect Nazgul do not affect Ringwraiths. The
exception is that characters with combat bonuses against Nazgul also get
those bonuses against Ringwraiths.

Ringwraiths may not move from one Darkhaven to another with non-Ringwraith characters.

#### Ringwraith Followers

Ringwraith followers may still use magic as printed on their card.

#### Sage Only

Any card requiring a sage to play is a sage only card.

#### Short-event

Short-events are discarded when resolved in a chain of effects, not
when declared. Thus, they can be targetted by certain special effects in
the chain of effects.

#### Sideboard

The sideboard is increased to 25 cards.

You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent's
Wizard is in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent's
untap phase and then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgul
permament-event to do so. The hazard limit against all of your
opponent's companies that turn is halved, rounded up.

Tapping a Nazgul to bring cards in from the sideboard does not turn
the Nazgul into a short-event. The Nazgul permanent-event is discarded
upon declaration of this effect as per Annotation 6.

#### Site

To untap a site the character doing so must be at that site.

#### Site Path

The site path depends on what sort of movement was used. If using
starter movement between Havens the site path is given on the Haven card
in the text box. If using starter movement to or from a non-Haven site
the site path is given on the non-Haven site, along the left side of the
card. If using region movement the site path is determined by the region
cards played on the company. In all of the above cases the site path
includes the site you are moving to. For a Ringwraith player substitute
Dark Haven in the above paragraph.

Certain cards refer to the site's site path. The site's site path is
always the site path given on the site card, regardless of how the
company got to that site.

Events can alter both the site's site path and a company's site path.

#### Skill Cards

Two skill cards may be played at one time on the same character
outside of combat.

#### Tap

Tapping a character does not tap that character's items.
A spell only taps a Wizard if the spell card says it does.

#### Targets

An action that is played out through one or more specific entities as
stated on a card or in the rules is considered to "target" the entities.
A targeted entity is said to be a "target" of the action. A card that
acts on a class of entities does not target them.

Annotation 1: A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain
of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card
may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An
exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g. a corruption check.

Annotation 2: A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be
targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared.

Annotation 3: Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets
because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they
generally affect an entire class of things.

Annotation 4: An action may not target a face-down card nor any
element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site
cards and on-guard cards.

You cannot target an opponent's character or resouces with your own
resources.

Events that target sites can only target sites in play used to show a
company's location or movement.

#### Timing

The validity of an effect, including the hazard limit, is checked
upon declaration and upon resolution.

Annotation 24: If a card specifices that more than one action occur
when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all of these
actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted
and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur
between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are
considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are
printed.

(amendment to original version of Annotation 24): As an exception, if
one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that
cancel the attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are
playable during the strike sequence--see Annotation 18.

Annotation 27: If a card has optional effects, the player playing the
card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the
card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When
such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for the choice of
effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discarded. The
player may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect
of the card.

#### Trophies

Creatures whose marshalling points are listed with an * give
marshalling points when used as trophies.
Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies.

@ Can be discarded to satisfy thief creatures.

#### Under-deeps

Marshalling points with companies at an Under-deeps site do not count
only for the purposes of calling the Free Council. They do count at the
actual Council itself.

When a company's site of origin is an Under-deeps site and the
company reveals a new site at the start of its movement/hazard phase,
the company is declaring it will make a roll to determine if the
movement was successful. No cards can be played between the site being
revealed and the roll except for Reach of Ulmo.

If you move to an Under-deeps site from a tapped surface site, the
tapped surface site is dicarded at the end of the company's
movement/hazard phase. The discarded surface site is not available until
it is returned to your location deck.

At an Under-deeps site, after a successul rescue attempt, a character
can tap for a minor item only.

#### Wizard

You may put two of the same Wizard in your deck, or you may put one
copy each of two different Wizards in your deck.

## IV. Tournament Rulings

Tournament rulings are modifications and additions to the rules
presented in the Unlimited Edition rulesbook that are required for
sanctioned Council of LÃ³rien tournament play.

#### General

Dice must be used to obtain random numbers.

There is a required 30 card minimum for both resources and hazards for
sanctioned tournament play.

Up to 3 copies of one Wizard or Ringwraith is allowed in a play deck,
or up to 2 copies of one and 1 copy of another. One copy each of three
different Wizards or Ringwraiths is not allowed.

#### Deck Construction

Cards that can be played as either hazards or resources may count as
either for purposes of deck construction.

Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.

The following count as 1/2 a creature for deck construction: hazards
that can be played as creatures or events, At Home Dragon
manifestations, Ahunt Dragon manifestions and agents. Note that agents
count as characters in Ringwraith decks, not as 1/2 creatures.

#### The Character Draft

The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.

Each player reveals one character at a time from their pool,
simultaneously with their opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into
the starting parties, duplicated charcters are put aside and not allowed
in either starting company. Each player continues until they want to
stop, they have 20 points of mind in their starting company, or they
have five characters in their starting company.

Ringwraith players may start with 6 characters in the character
draft, not just 5.

If one player stops revealing characters, the other one may continue
to play charcters.

No player may reveal a character that would bring his starting
company's total mind over 20.

When players are finished, each may put up to 10 characters into
their deck, including characters from his starting pool that did not end
up in the starting company.

#### Great Secrets Buried There

If you play this card as a hazard on your opponent, you must be able
to provide your opponent with a copy of any uncommon Under-deeps sites
if he does not have a copy in his location deck.

#### Map Movement

Maps of the regions of MECCG may be used in place of region cards in
Council of LÃ³rien tournaments. If two companies move on the same turn,
then the second company does not have to determine the site path to its
new site until the begining of it's movement/hazard phase.

#### The Weakest Link Method

If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption point to
each non-Wizard in play. Each character then makes a corruption check
and marshalling points are recounted.

Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all non-Wizard
characters are corrupted away.

## V. Card Errata and Rulings

### -A-

#### Abductor

Treat character discarded by Abductor to be discarded but not
eliminated.

#### AkhÃ´rahil

Card Erratum: Change "...gives -1 penalty to one..." to "...modifies any
one character's body by -1 for the rest of the turn.

#### Alatar

Card Erratum: Change ":he must tap and make a corruption check
immediately following the attack." to ": he must make a corruption check
immediately following the attack, and, if untapped, he must tap."

Alatar stays with a company if he uses his special ability to aid
that company.

Alatar can force someone to draw 0 cards when he moves.

When Alatar uses his special ability he must face a strike, and this
can interfere with the attacker assigning a strike.

Alatar can use his "teleport" ability if he is wounded, tapped, or
untapped. Alatar always faces a strike when he teleports, regarless of
his wounded or tapped status. Alatar must teleport and declare he is
facing a strike before any other strikes are assigned.

Allies Alatar controls are discarded when he teleports.

#### Align PalantÃ­r

Card Erratum: Add "May not be duplicated on a given PalantÃ­r."
Align PalantÃ­r can be stored.

#### Army of the Dead

Card Erratum: Add "May not be influenced by an opponent."

#### A Short Rest

This card only allows the extra card draw for moving companies that
actually have a site path. If a company moves with Eagle-mounts, for
example, it does not have a site path and does not trigger A Short Rest.
Thank you, Wolfgang, for illustrating this point.

#### Assassin

All of the strikes will go against the same character.

If an attack from Assassin is given more than one strike, each
additional strike becomes an excess strike (-1 prowess modification)
against the attacked character. An Assassin can never assign strikes to
more than one character.

You may decide to cancel one of the attacks after facing another
attack.

#### Aware of Their Ways

Consider sites to be unique cards for the play of this card.

### -B-

#### Baduila

Read "If Baduila is discarded" as "If you choose to discard Baduila."

least one character in the company during whose site phase Balance of
Things is revealed carries at least one corruption source.

#### Balrog of Moria

is out of play, even if she is eliminated.

You cannot get the MP from a Balrog of Moria that you played.

#### Bane of the Ithil-stone

Bane of the Ithil-stone will only cancel effects outside of normal
play as outlined in the rules. It will not stop you from drawing cards
when moving or discarding and drawing at the end of the turn. It will
not stop getting cards from the sideboard. It will stop looking thourgh
the discard piles or play decks.

If a card has multiple effects, Bane will only cancel those effects
that concern searching through decks and discard piles.

#### Bill the Pony

Card Erratum: The body should be 10, not 6.

Bill's special ability may not be used at an under-deeps site.

#### Black Rider

This card does not allow Ringwraiths to use region movement.

Ring at the time, or else Cracks of Doom has no effect.

If the body check forced by Dragon's Blood fails, the character is
not wounded.

No body check is required if the affected strike is ineffectual.

#### Dragon's Desolation

Playing Dragon's Desolation to make a Dragon playable at a Ruins &
Lairs does not necessarilly require you to play a Dragon later in the
turn.

#### Dragon's Hunger

Card Erratum: Replace "Otherwise, the attack is cancelled." with
"Otherwise, the attack is cancelled and the opponent must reveal his
hand."

This card can be played regardless of how much of the hazard limit is

effects following the resolution of Fell Beast. If a Nazgul is not
played immediately following the resolution of this card, this card is

effect that happens automatically.

#### Gollum's Fate

This card is considered to target both The One Ring and Gollum.

#### Golodhros

He may use his special influence ability only during an opponent's
movement/hazard phase, not during the site phase. His tapping to use his
special ability does not count against the hazard limit.

#### Great Goblin

to twice"

Hidden Knife.

#### Hoarmurath of Dir

the afflicted character's movement/hazard phase. Of course, the
character's player can play resources to modify the corruption checks.

directly affect the corruption checks caused by Lure of Nature. He can
play no other hazards, no creature, no new corruption cards, etc.
