There is no CRF 3. Or, it is possible that the CRF labeled "CRF 2" which was posted on ICE's website was actually CRF 3. There are quite a few date/ruling inconsistencies in the early CRF versions. These inconsistencies may have been caused by the delays in issuing/approving CRF 1 after FAQ 7 and/or as a result of ICE's 3rd party webmaster.
 - CRF 1 includes new/changed rulings company to FAQ #7, its predecessor, but without these changes being marked as new/changed.
 - CRF 2 was stated to be issued at the beginning of December 1996 but includes rulings through January 1997.
 - New rulings issued between the _METD_ Player Guide and the _MEDM_ Player Guide are marked as new in CRF 2.
 - CRF 4 was stated to be "current as of 02-28-97" but includes new rulings from March 1997 and was not published until May 1997.
