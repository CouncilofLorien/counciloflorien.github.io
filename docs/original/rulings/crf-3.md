[^CRF3]: There is no CRF 3 or it was merged with CRF 2. There were new rulings between the _METD_ Player Guide and the _MEDM_ Player Guide but all of these are found in CRF 2 with markings as being new. The CRF was initially thought to be published monthly but there were delays in even issuing CRF 1 after FAQ 7. And CRF 2 was said to be issued at the beginning of December 1996 but includes rulings through January 1997 and would have been reviewed after that. There also appears to be a dating issue as CRF 4 is stated to be "current as of 02-28-97" but includes new rulings from March 1997 and was not published until May 1997.
