There is no CRF 3. Given the delays in issuing CRF 1 after FAQ 7 and given that Ichabod, maintainer of the FAQ and CRF, was receiving compensation material (booster packs) for work performed, it appears that CRF 4 was the fourth CRF that Ichabod submitted to ICE as a work product even though only two CRFs were approved and published at the time.

Its also ppssible that CRF2 incorporated later changes without being given a new version number as CRF 2 was said to be issued at the beginning of December 1996 but includes rulings through January 1997.

A similar issue appears in CRF 4, stated to be "current as of 02-28-97" but includes new rulings from March 1997 and was not published until May 1997. For reference, there were new rulings between the _METD_ Player Guide and the _MEDM_ Player Guide but all of these are found in CRF 2 with markings as being new.
