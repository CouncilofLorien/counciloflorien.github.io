# Annotated CRF

The Collected Rulings File (CRF) for the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_ includes clarifications and errata. A common misconception is that only _errata_ could change how the game played and that _clarifications_ were merely explanations. This miconception is dispelled by ICE's own description of these terms from the _Companion_ books: _If a card or rule lists an errata, it means that the text of the card is wrong or incomplete. If a card or rule lists clarification, it means the text could be ambiguous._ Both clarifications and errata can change how a card or rule work, but errata changes the wording while a clarification explains or adds to the existing wording without changing it. Given that too much errata had been the death of other CCGs at the time, ICE was obstinant against issuing "errata."

This document annotates version 15 of the Collected Rulings File (CRF) (29 May 1999) which was the last official CRF issued for the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_. 

The last time that the CRF was extensively overhauled before that was for version 6 of the CRF (10 July 1997). The only other time it was overhauled was when it changed from the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to the CRF format for version 1 (24 October 1996).

Collected Clarifications to the Rules
{: .text-center .text-beta}

## Introduction

This is version 15 of the collected clarifications to the rules for the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_, up to May 29, 1999; including up to digest 578 of the mailing list. Some of these clarifications are considered errata to the rules or cards, and are noted as such. The [Turn Sequence](#turn-sequence-rulings) and [Rulings by Term](#rulings-by-term) sections are specifically considered clarifications to the rules, and are therefore overridden by card text that specifically does so. A [complete list of errata](#complete-errata-listing) is included. There will be periodic updates to this file, and items marked with a "@" are new or changed since the last version.

New rulings that clarify ambiguous situtations take effect immediately. Reversals of old rulings, changes to the rules, and new rulings not covering ambiguous situations will not have an effect on tournament play until two to four weeks after they are made. Every other Monday, starting November 3, 1997, will be a [Rulings Monday](#rulings-monday). On a Rulings Monday, delayed rulings that have been made will be announced on the internet, and rulings that were announced on the previous Rulings Monday will take effect.

The main thing to remember, when making rulings based on the rules and the cards, is that if it isn't there, then it isn't there. If a card says a site counts as a Haven for purposes of healing, that does not mean the site counts as a Haven for any other purposes. If a card says it can be played as a resource, that does not mean it counts as a resource at any time except when it is being played. Remember: If it isn't there, it isn't there.

Tournament rules for _MECCG_ differ slightly from the rules for casual play. Rulings marked with a "#" differ from those in tournament play. When playing in a tournament, be sure to check the [Tournament Rulings](#tournament-rulings) section.

### Beginning of the Game

 - \# If a character is put in the deck due to duplication in the starting company, then it does not count against the 10 character limit.
     - In [3 • GETTING READY TO PLAY of _METW_](the-wizards-unlimited.md/#3--getting-ready-to-play) and [3 • GETTING READY TO PLAY of_MELE_](the-lidless-eye.md/#3--getting-ready-to-play) (when not using the Character Draft), duplicated characters are placed into the play deck at Step 3 and then up to 10 characters are placed into the play deck at Step 5. There is a limit of 10 characters placed into the play deck in Step 5. However, there is no specific limit on the total number of characters placed into the play deck during Step 3 and 5 combined. 
 - \# You should either draw numbers for the whole game or roll dice for the whole game.
 -  Your starting company can only contain 20 points of unmodified mind.
 -  Non-character cards duplicated in the character draft may not be placed into the play deck.
 -  Your staring hand is eight cards, regardless of what characters you have at particular sites.

### Untap Phase

 -  Corruption checks triggered at the end of the untap phase happen after everyone untaps.

### Organization Phase

#### Choosing a New Site

 -  _Rules Erratum:_ When a company splits, any of the resulting companies can move with region movement. Region movement is not limited to one company of a split.
 -  Any single site path cannot have more than one copy of a particular region.
 -  Any company may declare as its new site a site already on the table. That site will remain on the table at least until the end of that company's movement/hazard phase.
 -  Two companies may not start at the same site of origin and move to the same new site.
 -  Effects that are played during the organization phase, and depend on the site or site path of a moving company, create an effect which is not declared until the new site is revealed. If the site or site path is not of the appropriate type when the effect resolves, the resource has no effect. If the company has multiple movement/hazard phases on the same turn, the card applies separately to each phase, having an effect only if the correct conditions are met.

#### Followers

 -  A character cannot use a bonus to direct influence against "Blue Mountain Dwarves" to control characters with the home site Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold. The bonus only applies to the faction.
 -  Bonuses to direct influence against characters apply only once, not for each character.

#### Organizing Companies

 - When a company splits up, its player chooses which characters are the original company and which characters are a new company, unless otherwise directed by a card. All resource permanent-events played on the original company stay with the original company.
 -  Company composition changes that you choose to make, including bringing a character into play, must all be done at the same time during the organization phase. During this time no other actions may be taken.
 - If a company splits, all but one of the split companies must attempt to move to a different site this turn. The company may not rejoin in the same phase.
 - You may transfer a character from one company at a site to another, without creating a third company.
 - See also Rulings by Term, [Company](#company) and [Influence](#influence).
 
#### Playing Characters

 - _Rules Erratum:_ You may play a character if you do not have enough influence to control them. However, if there are any characters you do not have the influence to control at the end of your organization phase, the character you brought into play this turn must be returned to your hand.
 - If you play a Ringwraith at a non-Darkhaven site where there is one of your non-Ringwraith companies, one of the companies must move that turn. If both companies are still there at the end of the movement/hazard phase, discard the non-Ringwraith company. \[Effective 11/17/97]()

#### Storing Items

 -  Minions who roll equal to or one less than their accumulated corruption when storing an item are only tapped.
 -  A minion who taps from a corruption check for storing/transferring an item still successfully stores/transfers that item.

### Long Event Phase

### Movement/Hazard Phase

#### General

 -  **Annotation 25:** A company is considered to be at the site given by its site card at all times except from the moment their new site card is revealed during their movement/hazard phase until their old site card is discarded during the same movement/hazard phase. During this period a company is considered to be en route between sites and not at any site.
 -  **Annotation 25a:** A company's movement/hazard phase is concluded when a moving company removes its site of origin and both players agree to reconcile (discard down to/draw up to) their hand sizes. No resources (and obviously no hazards) can be played, and no resource effects can be activated, until the site phase or until both players have drawn cards for the movement of a following company.
 -  **Annotation 25b:** Players drawing cards when a new site is revealed is synonymous with the resolution of the new site being revealed. It happens immediately, not in the following chain of effects.
 -  **Annotation 26:** If at the start of a player's movement/hazard phase, there are multiple effects in play such that their net effect depends on the order they are applied, the player who is currently not taking his turn (i.e., the hazard player) decides the order in which they are to be applied. Once this interpretation is established, all further actions are applied in theborder they are resolved for the rest of the turn.
 -  Once the effects of an environment card have been applied to a target during a given movement/hazard phase, that effect is not applied again to that target during the current turn.
 -  When you draw cards for movement, you may continue drawing cards until you either want to stop, or have drawn the number of cards allowed for the movement.
 -  Companies at the same non-Haven/non-Darkhaven site must join at the end of all movement/hazard phases, before the site phase starts. Companies at the same Haven/Darkhaven site may join at this time.
 -  If companies would join at the end of the movement/hazard phase such that the company composition rules are violated, one company of the hazard player's choice must return to its site of origin.
 -  If two companies join at a site, cards affecting one of the companies now affect them both.
 -  Removing the site of origin and resetting to hand size are simultaneous actions, and they are the last actions in any movement/hazard phase. This means a moving company is not at a site until the site phase. [effective 11/17/97](#rulings-effective-111797)
 -  The same region (as in region card) may not occur twice in a single site path.
 -  A non-moving company's current site is considered its new site for card play.

### Movement

#### General
 -  If a company does not move, it still has a movement/hazard phase. No cards are drawn based on the company's movement, and the only hazards that can be played on the company are creatures that can be keyed to the company's site and events.
 -  Lebennin and Ithilien are not adjacent, even though they look that way on some maps.
 -  If a company moves twice in one turn, resources played during the organization phase, like _Secret Passage_, are reapplied to the company at the beginning of each of their movement/hazard phases, if the conditions of the card are met.
 -  If both players have access to region movement, then neither player may be stopped from using region movement. Access includes region cards or an appropriate map.

#### Playing Hazards

 -  Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an effect, and this does not count against the hazard limit unless specified otherwise on the card. [effective 11/17/97](#rulings-effective-111797)
 -  Hazards may only be played on a company whose movement/hazard phase is being resolved, or on the site they are moving to. Long-events and permanent-events may effect more than one company even though they are only played "on" one company.
 -  If a card must be keyed to two or more instances of a region type, those region types do not have to be consecutive in the site path.
 -  If you say you are done playing hazards and your opponent plays a resource before the movement/hazard phase ends, you may then resume playing hazards, assuming you have not yet reached the hazard limit.
 -  If a company is moving from a surface site to an Under-deeps site, hazards may not be played keyed to the region of the surface site.
 -  _Angmar Arises_, _In Darkness Bind Them_, and _Reaching Shadow_ may not be used to play creatures keyed to double shadow-lands.
 -  A creature "played at" a site is the same as being "keyed to" the site.
 -  A creature "played at a site in" a region is the same as being "keyed to" the site by name.
 - For the purposes of interpreting hazards, no Darkhaven or Haven has a site path except for Geann a-Lisch.
 -  You check the hazard limit at declaration and resolution. At declaration there must be less hazards already declared than the hazard limit. At resolution there must be no more hazards declared than the hazard limit.

#### Returning to Site of Origin
 -  If a company returns to its site of origin, its site path immediately disappears, and its movement/hazard phase immediately ends.
 -  An effect that returns a company to its site of origin may not be declared in the middle of an attack.
 -  @ _Rules Erratum_: If a company returns to it's site of origin, it may do nothing during it's site phase. A company failing it's underdeeps movement roll is not effected by this rule.

### Combat

#### General

 -  Side effects of losing a character are resolved immediately after the character is lost, before other characters resolve their strikes.
 -  All strikes of an attack must be assigned before any are resolved.
 -  See also Rulings by Term, Ally and Body Check; and Turn Sequence, Site Phase, Company vs. Company Combat.

#### Attack

 -  **Annotation 12**: An attack is considered to be resolved and concluded when the final strike, all special actions resulting from the final strike, and the associated body check are resolved.
 -  **Annotation 13**: An attack may not be canceled once its strikes have been assigned. A strike may not be canceled once the dice-roll for the strike has been made.
 -  **Annotation 14**: A canceled attack has no effect on its target company, except that the company is considered in its history to have faced the attack.
 -  **Annotation 15**: An attack must be the first declared action in a chain of effects, i.e., a creature card may not be played in response to another card in the same chain of effects. Revealing an on-guard creature is an exception.
 -  In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an attack, the character doing so must be in the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site type a hazard creature was keyed to can be affected otherwise.
 -  Cards only modify attacks if they say they specifically mention attacks.
 -  When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the MPs, the creature goes to the out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played the attack. They may still be taken as a trophy, but go to the appropriate out-of-play pile when the trophy is discarded.
 -  Excess strikes applied as -1 modifiers do not have to have their body defeated.
 -  If an attack states all characters in a company face a strike, then effects which allow a character to face more than one strike have no effect against the attack. Similarly, effects that change the attack's number of strikes have no effect. As an exception, effects which reduce the number of strikes to a specific number do work.
 -  Any effect that would change the number of strikes for an attack may not be played after strikes are assigned. This includes cards that have other additional effects, and cards that only indirectly change the number of strikes.
 -  Attacks created by events are not keyed to anything unless specifically stated as being keyed to something on the card.
 -  There are three levels of cards which reassign strikes. Alatar is the top level, and overrides any other conflicting card which changes the assignment of strikes. Cards which say they "always" or "in all cases" change the assignment of strikes are the next level, and override any other conflicting effects except Alatar. Cards which say they change the assignment of strikes "regardless of ..." certain factors are the third level, and are overridden by all other effects from conflicting cards. If two effects on the same level conflict, the resource overrides the hazard.
 -  If an attack can not be cancelled, strikes from the attack may still be cancelled.
 -  An attack is considered faced by a company if it successfully resolves in its chain of effects.
 -  Attacks or strikes keyed by name to a region or site cannot be cancelled by effects which refer only to the type of the region or site.

#### The Strike Sequence

 -  **Annotation 16**: When a wounded character becomes unwounded, he is considered in his history to have been wounded and must face any special actions the wounding strike presented him.
 -  **Annotation 17**: The only actions that may be declared during a strike sequence are those outlined in Annotation 18.
 -  **Annotation 18**: When a defending player chooses to resolve a strike against a particular character, the only actions that may be taken by either player until the strike dice-roll is made are the following: playing hazard cards that affect the strike, the attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications due to strikes in excess of the company's size, a target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not automatically tap, and the defending character may play resource cards that affect the strike. An action that has the condition that a target character tap, but which otherwise has an effect not outlined here, may not be declared at this point. This is true even if the recipient of the strike would be the target character tapping and thus receive -1 to his prowess.
 -  **Annotation 19**: Following each successful strike or failed strike, a body check must be rolled (unless the failed strike has no body). However, if the strike calls for any special actions to follow it (e.g., a character wounded by _"William"_ may be required to discard his items), these special actions are resolved before the body check. The body check is the first declared action in a nested chain of effects that immediately follows the strike dice-roll and special actions resulting from the strike. Other actions may be declared in response to a body check, in the same chain of effects, but these are limited to those actions that directly affect the body check dice-roll. E.g., _Tookish Blood_ could not be declared in response to the body check caused by _Giant Spiders_ wounding a Hobbit. No action may be declared in response to a special action resulting from a strike unless the special action is a dice-rolling action, i.e., a special action is generally considered synonymous with the strike dice-roll. If the special action is a dice-rolling action, an action may be declared in response to it if the action directly affects the dice-roll.
 -  **Annotation 20**: If more than one special action is to follow a strike, the defending player decides the order they are resolved.
 -  **Annotation 21**: A successful strike against a character is synonymous with that character being wounded, i.e., inverting a character card on the playing surface is not a separate action from the successful strike.
 -  Wounded characters only suffer a -2 prowess. In general, wounded characters are not considered tapped.
 -  Non-item prowess bonuses are applied in the order the player controlling the character decides.
 -  If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the character, the second strike is considered successful.
 - There is time between the strike sequences to take actions that are otherwise legal.

### Site Phase

#### General

 - Items, factions and allies must be played during the site phase.
 - There is no one resource card per site phase rule. However, the tapping of the site usually limits you to one card per site phase.
 - The site taps upon successful play of the resource that would tap it.
 - A company may not play any resource during the site phase until they have faced all automatic-attacks, unless that resource directly affects an automatic-attack. Removing an automatic-attack does not directly affect it, although cancelling does.
 - You may only play a free minor item after playing an ally, faction, or item that taps the site.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Item. 
 - Play of an ally, item, faction, or resource card which will normally tap the site must be after the company resolves all automatic, agent and on-guard creature attacks.

#### Company vs. Company Combat

 -  The defender may take actions that affect the attack or any of the strikes. The attacker may only take actions that affect individual strikes.
 -  _True Fana_ and _Sacrifice of Form_ cannot be used in company versus company combat.
 -  @ _Rules Erratum:_ Hazards effects in play that affect attacks have no effect on company vs. company combat.
 -  Only the defender is considered to be facing an attack, but all characters are considered to be facing strikes.
 -  Tapped defending characters choose their strikes after untapped attacking characters have assigned their strikes.
 -  Minion and hero companies can attack each other. Hero companies may not attack each other. A Fallen Wizard covert company is considered a hero company.
 -  See also Card Rulings, Swarm of Bats.
 
#### Automatic-attacks

 -  A card that can cancel an attack can cancel an automatic-attack, and this counts as facing the automatic-attack.
 -  Automatic-attacks added to a site are faced after the normal automatic- attacks for the site.
 -  Multiple automatic-attacks are faced in the order listed and/or resolved.
 -  Company composition and overt/covert status is checked before each automatic attack.
 -  Any character may tap to cancel one automatic-attack at his home site.
 -  The only resources you may play against automatic-attacks are ones that cancel the attack, cancel a strike, or would be otherwise playable during the strike sequence.

#### Influence Attempts

 -  @ It is not possible to influence anything away from a Wizard or Ringwraith.
 -  You may influence a Hobbit if you are not at Bag End.
 -  A successful influence attempt on an opponent's resource does not tap the site.
 -  You may only make one influence attempt against your opponent's resources during each turn.
 -  When influencing factions across alignments, you roll against the number on the card in play, that you are trying to influence away.
 -  For a Fallen-wizard, the resource revealed must match the alignment of the site at which the attempt is taking place.

#### On-Guard Cards

 -  _Rules Erratum_: An on-guard card may only be revealed if it could have also been played during the movement/hazard phase. This means all targets of the card must have existed during the movement/hazard phase in order for the card to be revealed.
 -  A revealed on-guard card retroactively takes effect as though it were both declared and resolved immediately prior to the chain of effects during which it was revealed.
 -  An on-guard card may be revealed when the company plays a resource that potentially taps the site. The card must affect the company or a character in the company that site phase. Note that this clarification is looser than the rule printed on p.61 of the Unlimited Rules book.
 -  A successful ring test does not allow an on-guard card to be revealed.
 -  You may reveal a card in response to an influence attempt against a faction even if the on-guard card only has an effect if the attempt is successful. You may also reveal a card in response to such an attempt that affects the actual influence attempt.
 -  Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be considered when determining the validity of revealing an on-guard card. Potential effects that have not been triggered cannot be considered.
 -  A card cannot be revealed that:
      - Returns a company to its site of origin.
      - Taps a company's site.
      - Potentially removes a character from a company, besides combat or corruption checks.
      - Forces a company to do nothing during its site phase.
      - Directly taps a character in the company.
 -  A card that potentially removes an ally from the company can be revealed, so long as it otherwise is legal.
 -  The on-guard card is not considered to be in any player's hand.
 -  When an on-guard card is revealed, it immediately ceases to be considered an on-guard card.
 -  Creatures may only be revealed on-guard if there is an automatic-attack at the site.
 -  If two companies are at a Haven, on-guard cards played on one company can only be revealed against that company, and can only affect that company (unless the hazard states it affects all versions of the site).
 -  @ If the site an on-guard card is played on leaves play before the site phase, the on-guard cards are returned to their owner's hand.
 -  See also Rulings By Term, Burglary Attempts.
 
### End-of-Turn Phase
 -  End-of-turn effects are triggered by the ending of the End-of-Turn phase. Once both players are done with all actions in the End-of-Turn phase, all End-of-Turn effects are declared and resolved in the order chosen by the current player. No further actions may be declared that turn.
 -  Cards may be played during the End-of-Turn phase after hand size has been reconciled.
 -  Replacing one site with another at the end of the turn counts as movement, without a movement/hazard phase.

### End-of-Game
 -  These rulings apply to any end game, whether it is the Free Council, the Audience with Sauron, or the Day of Reckoning.
 -  Characters may tap to aid corruption checks, if they are in the same company.
 -  Long- and permanent-events still in play will still have an effect.
 -  Only resources that directly affect corruption checks may be played during the Free Council. This includes cards that reduce a character's corruption point total or prevent a character from being discarded.
 -  When determining if more than half of your marshalling points come from one type of marshalling point, ignore negative marshalling points. The easy way to do this is if one category is more than half of your positive marshalling points, reduce that category to equal all of your other positive marshalling point categories combined.
 - To calculate marshalling points at the Free Council, follow these steps:
     - Total up the marshalling points for each category. The modifications from _My Precious_, factions played on a leader, and eliminated characters apply now.
     - If your opponent has no points in a category double your points in that category. Doubling does not apply to the Miscellaneous or Kill categories.
     - If one of your categories accounts for more than half of your positive marshalling point total, reduce it so that it has the same number of points as the rest of your positive categories combined.
     - Subtract any points that are subtracted from your total, including points from unique resources your opponent has duplicated in his hand.
     - See also Rulings by Term, Under-deeps.
 -  Marshalling points that minions have at an Under-deeps site do not count for calling the Audience with Sauron, but do count at the Audience with Sauron.
 -  You may only call the Free Council if you have met the deck cycling and marshalling point requirements, not if only your opponent has.
 -  You may not recieve kill MPs from a card you played.
 -  MPs from special and minor items count as item MPs.

### -= AAA =-

#### Actions
 - Tapping a resource can only be done at a time when you could otherwise play a resource event.

#### Active Conditions
 - An active condition must be in play or established when the action requiring it is declared. Active conditions serve as the price of an action. They are restrictions on the player invoking the action.
 - **Annotation 5**: If an action requires an entity to tap as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be untapped when the action is declared; else, the action may not be declared. Tap the entity at this point; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action. When it comes time to resolve the action in its chain of effects, that entity must still be in play and tapped or the action is canceled.
 - **Annotation 6**: If an action requires an entity to be discarded as a condition for the action's main effect, that entity must be discarded when the action is declared; this is considered synonymous with the action's declaration, i.e., it is not a separate action.
 - **Annotation 7:** If any other active condition for an action does not exist when the action is resolved, the action has no effect; if the action was playing a card from your hand, it is discarded.
 - **Annotation 8**: An action that requires a target is considered to have the active condition that the target be in play when the action is declared and when it is resolved. An action may not be declared if its target is not in play. However, dice-rolling actions may always be targeted by other actions declared later in the same chain of effects.
 - Your opponent's resources may be the active conditions for your resources, but may not be the targets for your resources.
 - If an "alternative" or "additional" effect does not have any "playable ..." conditions, then the "playable on ..." conditions from the primary effect of the card apply. The following cards are exceptions to this rule: _Gloom_, _Good Sense Revolts_, _Half an Eye Open_, _Heedless Revelry_, _Here is a Snake_, _In the Name of Mordor_, _Inner Cunning_, _Nobody's Friend_, _Withdrawn to Mordor_, and _Wolf-riders_.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Target.

#### Agent

 - _Rules Erratum:_ A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move from tapped status to utapped status).
 - _Rules Erratum:_ An agent may tap to play creatures at a site if the company is moving to the site.
 - _Rules Erratum:_ Agent attacks against minions are always detainment. [Effective 8/27/98]
 - Playing a card that makes an agent attack is considered the attack's declaration.
 - Agents are not creatures.
 - Rolls made by agents during combat are done simultaneously with rolls made by characters during combat, after step 4 of the strike sequence.
 - Only face-up agents are considered for uniqueness.
 - While in play agents played as hazards may not become minion characters, and agents played as minion characters may not become hazards.
 - An agent played as a character in a Ringwraith deck can only be played at his home site.
 - When constructing a Ringwraith deck, agents are always considered characters. The maximum of 36 mind of agents in your sideboard and play deck combined still applies.
 - To wound an agent you only need to defeat the prowess of one strike. To eliminate an agent you must defeat the prowess and body for all strikes.
 - Revealed agents may return to their home site, even if they are at one of their home sites.
 - Cards played on an agent remain face up when the agent turns face down.
 - Agents may not move to any version of a hero Haven, unless they have a special ability allowing them to.
 - Fallen-wizards use minion rules for agents, except where specified by the White Hand rules insert.
 - Only Elven agents can move to a site that is a Wizardhaven.
 - Agent attacks are not keyed to anything.
 - When an agent is revealed, only the site he is at will be affected by environment cards.
 - Agents do not get the -5 penalty for influencing across alignments.
 - If you are a Ringwraith, your agents may move as if Dagorlad and Udun are adjacent.
 - The rules on agent movement do not apply to revealed agents, since they refer to the first site card played, which is discarded when the agent is revealed the first time.
 - When you flip an agent face down, leave it's current site face up with the agent. That now counts as a legal first card "played" for when you reveal the agent again.
 - Agents in starting companies count against the 36 mind limit.
 - An agent may only attack once per site phase.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Card Effect Limitations.

#### Ahunt Manifestations

 - If one Ahunt is out and you move through two or more of the regions listed on it, then you face the attack once.

#### Ally

 - Allies may tap to cancel attacks from _Slayers_ and _Assassins_.
 - Allies cannot be targeted to be taken prisoner, and otherwise cannot be taken prisoner.
 - If an ally may not be attacked by certain attacks, he may still tap to give +1 prowess to characters facing such attacks.
 - Playing an ally is not an influence attempt.
 - If an ally's controller leaves play for any reason, that ally is discarded.
 - Allies can be healed as if they were characters. Otherwise, allies are only considered characters for the purposes of combat and playing skill cards.
 - Allies count as characters for the purposes of combat, including performing actions in combat that characters do (getting assigned strikes, tapping for +1 to prowess) and for the play of cards that directly affect the attack.

### -= BBB =-

#### Balrog

 - @ _Erratum_: Balrog players receive no MPs for hero items played at their darkhavens.

#### Burglary Attempts

 - After a successful burglary attempt, another character may tap to play a minor item.
 - The character who fails the burglary roll must face the automatic-attack as though he were a one-character company. He can receive no combat support other than what he himself can provide.
 - On-guard creatures are faced by the whole company after a Burglaring attempt, regardless of the success of the attempt.

#### Body Check

 - **Annotation 22**: When a character fails a body check, his items may be immediately reassigned to unwounded characters in his company, one item per character. Reassigning of the eliminated character's items is considered to be synonymous with his failed body check, i.e., no action may take place between the failed check and reassigning the items. Unassigned items are discarded.
 - Effects that modify a character's body also modify the number an Orc or Troll would be discarded on. A maximum to body applies equally to the discard number.
 - If an Orc or Troll could be discarded and eliminated by a result, discard them instead of eliminating them.
 - "Affecting the body check" includes modifying the die roll or the body of the character making the check.
 - See also Movement/Hazard Phase, Combat, General.

### -= CCC =-

#### Cannot be Duplicated
 - **Annotation 11** (modified from its original version): Some cards cannot be duplicated in limited cases---generally on a specific target. Multiple copies of these cards or their effects may be in play normally, so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated can be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being targeted by an effect that will discard it.
 - Short-events that cannot be duplicated cannot be played if a card of the same name is currently having an effect on play.

#### Card Effect Limitations
 - You may not play the following cards if your opponent is a Ringwraith or Sauron. Additionally, if you are not a Ringwraith or Sauron, a Ringwraith or Sauron opponent can play these cards against you and not be affected by any of their global effects.
     - All hazard events that require an agent\*
     - _Bane of the Ithil-stone_
     - _The Black Enemy's Wrath_
     - _Foul Fumes_
     - _In the Heart of His Realm_
     - _Mordor in Arms_
     - _Mumak_
     - _Worn and Famished_
 - \* _Near to Hear a Whisper_ and _Sudden Fury_ from _Middle-earth: Against the Shadow_ and _Great Need or Purpose_ may be played because they do not target a specific agent.
 - The following cards are also listed in the _MELE_ Rules book as having no effect on a Ringwraith/Sauron player, but this interpretation has been modified.
     - _Chance of Being Lost_ and _Winds of Wrath_: You may play these cards against any opponent who is using the same type of location deck (hero sites or minion sites) as yourself.
     - _Great Secrets Buried There_: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or Sauron player.
     - _The Nazgul are Abroad_: This card may be played against a Ringwraith or Sauron player. The only restriction is that the first two paragraphs are ignored when you play Nazgul creatures against a Ringwraith or Sauron opponent. Any player can recycle Nazgul hazards as stated on the card.

#### Challenge Decks
 - Page 12 should say that companies must join at non-Haven sites. Companies at Havens at the end of the movement/hazard phase may join or not as they choose.
 - The end-of-turn phase was left out of the rulesbook. During the end of turn phase you may discard one card, then you must reset to hand size.
 - In the Dwar deck (H) and the Indur deck (J), _The Arkenstone_ should have the icon for a play deck card, not a sideboard card.
 - Old Forest should read "healing effects," not "healing cards."

#### Character
 - A character enacting an effect counts as a character in his company, and may affect himself as a character in the company.
 - A character in play must always be in one of three independent states: untapped, tapped, or wounded.
 - You can have three of a non-unique character in your deck.
 - Prowess modifications due to tapped and wounded status apply only during the strike sequence.
 - See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Followers and Playing Characters.

#### Command Cards
 - Command cards return other command cards of the same name to your hand.

#### Company
 - If all characters in a company are removed from the company, all resource permanent-events played on the company as a whole are discarded.
 - If all characters in a company leave play, the site goes to the location deck or discard pile, depending on its tapped status. If this happens during the movement/hazard phase, the site card stays in play until the end of all movement/hazard phases. In this case, on-guard cards may still be played on the site.
 - The following allies make a company overt: _The Balrog_, _Creature of an Older World_, _Great Bats_, _Great Lord of Goblin-gate_, _Last Child of Ungoliant_, _Regiment of Black Crows_, and _"Two- headed" Troll_.
 - Entities associated with a company include the characters, allies, and items in the company, and any events played on the company or on another entity in the company. The new site and site of origin are not entities associated with the company.
 - A hero company is Wizard player's company, or a Fallen-wizard's company that has no Orcs or Trolls. A minion company is a Ringwraith player's company, or a Balrog player's company. An overt company is a company with Orcs and/or Trolls in it. Note that some allies can make a company overt, but Half-orcs do not.
 - See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Organizing Companies; and Rulings by Term, Influence.

#### Corruption
 - _Rules Erratum_: Corruption cards must always start a chain of effects. [Effective 8/27/98]
 - **Annotation 23**: When a character fails a corruption check, the standard effects of this (i.e., the character being discarded or eliminated and his items being discarded) are implemented immediately and are considered synonymous with the failed check. A card causing the corruption check may modify the standard effects of a failed check (e.g. _The Precious_), but this timing would not be changed. Certain cards, e.g., _Traitor_, which do not cause a corruption check, but specify an action that results from the passive condition of a failed check, take effect as the first declared action in a chain of effects immediately following the chain of effects that contains the corruption check.
 - Characters with 0 corruption points must still make corruption checks.
 - A character may attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping. The roll is at -3.
 - You can not attempt to remove a corruption card without tapping if you have attempted to remove that card already this turn. You may not tap to remove a corruption card that you tried to remove without tapping already this turn.
 - The resolution of a character tapping to give +1 to a corruption check happens when the corruption check itself resolves.
 - If an effect is in play that prevents a character from being discarded, the character is not considered to fail his corruption check if a result is achieved that would discard him. A Wizard would not be eliminated and his player would not lose the game.
 - A character attempting to remove a corruption card on another character may ignore the tapping requirement and recieve -3 to the roll.
 - See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Storing Items.

### -= DDD =-

#### Darkhaven
 - Rules Erratum: Attacks keyed to Darkhavens are detainment. [effective 11/17/97]
 - Whenever a hazard affecting heroes refers to a Darkhaven, interpret it as referring to a Haven instead.
 - Attacks at Darkhavens are canceled only if the company is at the Darkhaven.
 - Darkhavens count as their own nearest Darkhaven.

#### Detainment Attacks
 - When a strike from a detainment attack succeeds, the character who was facing that particular strike must tap.
 - Attacks that have special effects when they wound a character do not have that effect when they are detainment attacks. This is because detainment attacks never wound a character.

#### Discard
 - A discarded non-Wizard/non-Ringwraith character may be brought into play again by any player.
 - When a card is discarded, so are all permanent-events on that card.
 - Cards discarded from a player's hand must be discarded one at a time. This is mainly to allow a Pallando player to see each card as it is discarded.
 - Whenever a character is discarded, all non-follower cards played with that character are also discarded.
 - If a card leaves active play, including being returned to a player's hand, it immediately ceases having an effect on play. \[effective 11/3/97]
 - Cards in the discard pile do not remember how they were played.

#### Dragons
 - Dragon automatic-attacks are not considered manifestations of any unique Dragon.
 - If a manifestation of a unique Dragon is defeated, then the automatic-attack at the associated site is removed, and that site therefore loses its hoard status.
 - If you defeat the attack from a Dragon manifestation, you get kill marshalling points from the manifestation as if you had defeated a creature.

### -= EEE =-

#### Eliminated
 - When a card is eliminated, all permanent-events on that card are discarded.

#### Exhausted
 - Permanent-events discarded when the play deck is exhausted are shuffled into the new play deck along with the rest of the discard pile.

### -= FFF =-

#### Fallen-wizard
 - The white hand symbol on the Fallen-wizard card is that Fallen-wizard's general influence once he is revealed. Prior to that, his general influence is 20.
 - A Fallen-wizard may use a minion resource to cancel the automatic-attack at a hero site, and vice versa.
 - Fallen-wizards may not play characters with more than five mind, but if they have one in play the character is not discarded.
 - A Fallen-wizard is at -5 for influence attempts against a Ringwraith, but not against a Wizard.
 - Fallen-wizards may not use starter movement, but they may use any other form of movement.
 - Fallen-wizards use Ringwraith rules for agents.
 - You may not declare yourself as a specific Fallen-wizard unless you have his card in your deck.
 - Fallen-wizards can have a character with more than five mind, they just can't start with one or play one.
 - For starting companies, minor items come into play after characters, so they cannot affect a character's mind for the purpose of playing him.
 - When a site is replaced with a site of the opposite alignment, the new site comes into play in the same orientation as the other site.
 - You may use minion or hero resources to affect the automatic-attack at a site, regardless of the site's alignment.
 - If any version of a site is in play or in your discard pile, you may not play another version of that site.
 - Fallen-wizards may recieve one extra MP for factions played on a leader.
 - Fallen-wizards may not play Bade to Rule.
 - If you reveal your Fallen-wizard, and no longer have enough influence to control your characters, discard other characters until you can control them all.
 - None of a Fallen-wizards MPs may be modified by non-stage resources.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Specific.

### -= GGG =-

#### Gold Ring Item
 - When a gold ring item is tested, the ring is discarded and its marshalling points are lost whether or not you are able to play a special item.
 - Ring special items played as a result of storing a ring at a Darkhaven come into play stored.

### -= HHH =-

#### Hand Size
 - Effects which increase your hand size or allow you to hold one more card in your hand mean that you draw up to your new hand size or discard down to it at the appropriate points during the game.
 - Effects which increase hand size are cumulative.
 - See also Card Errata and Rulings, Favor of the Valar.

#### Haven
 - Havens can tap. 
 - Whenever a hazard affecting minions refers to a Haven, interpret it as referring to a Darkhaven instead. Havens count as their own nearest Haven.
 - If two companies join at a Haven, cards played on the discarded version of the Haven transfer to the version of the Haven that stays in play.

#### Hobbits
 - If a Hobbit is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be brought back into play normally at Bag End.

### -= III =-

#### Influence
 - Restricted direct influence is limited in its use, usually to characters and/or factions of specific races. Unrestricted influence has no use restrictions.
 - When a character suffers a minus to direct influence, it must come from unrestricted direct influence first. If there is no unrestricted influence and there are multiple instances of restricted direct influence, the player may choose which restricted direct influence the minus is applied to.
 - A character removed from the control of direct influence outside the organization phase does not need to be controlled by general influence until that player's next organization phase.
 - Changes to general influence take place immediately, with a minimum of zero free general influence.
 - See also Turn Sequence, Organization Phase, Followers and Organizing Companies; and Rulings by Term, Company.

#### Items

 - The "free" minor item may only be played immediately after playing the resource that taps that site.

### -= LLL =-

#### Leader
 - Factions played with a leader are worth two extra MP per group of factions, not per faction.

### -= MMM =-

#### Manifestations
 - A Fallen-wizard (nor any other player) may not have two resource manifestations of the same unique resource in his deck.

#### Marshalling Point Pile
 - Under standard rules, no more than half of your marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling point. Do not round up. The easiest way to deal with this is to set the category with the most marshalling points to equal the total of all other categories of marshalling points.
 - You may not target hazards in your opponent's marshalling point pile for removal.
 - You may not gain marshalling points from a hazard you played yourself.

#### May not Untap
 - Nothing may untap a character who is the subject of an effect that states the character may not untap.

#### MELE vs. METW

 - Hero items may not be used as conditions for minion resources, and minion items may not be used as conditions for hero resources. Note that a Fallen-wizard may play special ring items regardless of the alignment of the gold ring item tested.
 - \# If you are playing against a deck with three Wizards in it, you may play any combination of three Ringwraiths, except one each of three different Ringwraiths.
 - You may not have both the minion and hero version of a unique item in your deck.

#### Minion characters

 - Minion characters are not affected by cards that target agents.

#### Modes

 - When one mode effect is applied to a Ringwraith, all other cards applying a mode effect to that Ringwraith are discarded.
 - When a Ringwraith is in a mode, only apply the effects listed on the mode card, on the Ringwraith, and in the rules for that mode. Do not worry about cards that are not in play.
 - If an ally giving a mode is removed from play during the movement/hazard phase, the Ringwraith immediately stops being in that mode, but continues to move to his new site.

#### Multi-player Games

 - Only the moving player, and the hazard player drawing cards based on his movement, may take advantage of drawing cards, including cards drawn for events like _The Nazgul are Abroad_ and _From the Pits of Angband_. These two players are also the only ones who may discard a card at the end of the turn.
 - All players reset their hand size when any turn or movement/hazard phase ends.
 - In multi-player games the following hazards count as 1/2 a creature: hazards that can be played as events or creatures, _Ahunt_ Dragon manifestations, and _At Home_ Dragon manifestations. Agents in a Wizard deck also count as 1/2 creatures.
 - You may only play _The Lidless Eye_ if none of your opponents are Ringwraiths.
 - _Twilight_ may only be played by the moving player and the hazard player. As an exception, a player who's own environment will be discarded by an environment may play _Twilight_ to cancel that environment.
 - For _Spying out the Land_ and _Here is a Snake_, each hazard player shows hazards immediately before he draws and/or plays hazards, and then can only play those hazards. Players who are not playing hazards are not required to show hazards.
 - Actions taken during the movement/hazard phase, against a specific player, must be done against the moving player.

### -= NNN =-

#### Normal

 - Normal means as written on the card, not considering other card's effects. Note that this definition only applies to effects refering to card texts.

#### Nazgul

 - If a Nazgul is tapped to become a short-event as printed on its card, it turns into a short-event upon declaration. At this point, the Nazgul is a short-event just as if had been played as such from your hand.
 - The body referred to in the text of female characters with combat bonuses against Nazgul is the body of the Nazgul

### -= OOO =-

#### Off to the Side

 - Host cards of cards off to the side can be targeted normally.

#### Optional Rules

 - If a character is facing two strikes, and the first strike kills the character, the second strike is considered successful.
 - A character tapping to face two strikes is at -3 prowess against both strikes. The character taps when resolving the second strike.
 - For recently visited sites in multi-player games, the automatic-attack gets +1 for each player who has that site in their discard pile.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Burglary Attempts.

### -= PPP =-

#### Passive Conditions

 - A passive condition causes an action to happen as stated on a card already in play.
 - **Annotation 9**: If a card specifies that an action is to occur as a result of some specific passive condition, this action becomes automatically the first action declared in the chain of effects to immediately follow the chain of effects producing the passive condition. The passive condition must exist when this resulting action is resolved in its own chain of effects, or the action is canceled. Note that actions in the strike sequence follow a different set of rules.
 - **Annotation 9a**: If a card is required to be discarded by some passive condition, the card is discarded immediately when the condition resolves, not in the following chain of effects.
 - **Annotation 10**: If more than one action is required to be the first action declared in a chain of effects, the player whose turn it is chooses the order in which they are declared. No other actions may be declared in this follow-up chain until the multiple required actions have been declared.
 - A card causing an action as a result of a passive condition must be in play when the action resolves, or else the action is canceled.

#### Playing a Card

 - Playing a card is the process of bringing a card from your hand into play.
 - You may not play a card which has no effect on the game. Causing a dice roll is considered to be having an effect on the game.

### -= RRR =-

#### Reveal

 - Any revealed cards are shown to all players.

#### Ring Items

 - You should shuffle your deck after searching it for a Lesser Ring.

#### Ringwraith

 - You may have any number of Ringwraiths in your sideboard, as long as you do not duplicate more than one of them in the combined deck and sideboard.
 - Characters with combat bonuses against Nazgul also get those bonuses against Ringwraiths. However, other effects that affect Nazgul do not affect Ringwraiths.
 - Ringwraiths may not move from a non-Darkhaven site to another non-Darkhaven site unless they are using Dwar Unleashed. This means a Ringwraith may not move to Under-deeps sites that do not have a Darkhaven for a surface site.

#### Ringwraith Follower

 - Ringwraith followers may still use magic as printed on their card.
 - When your revealed Ringwraith leaves play without being eliminated, you have until the end of your next organization phase to bring your Ringwraith back into play, and use him to re-control any Ringwraith followers. Otherwise, all Ringwraith followers are discarded.

### -= SSS =-

#### Sage Only

 - Any card requiring a sage to play is a sage only card.

#### Short-event

 - Short-events are discarded when resolved in a chain of effects, not when declared. Thus, they can be targeted by certain special effects in the chain of effects.

#### Sideboard

 - The sideboard is increased to 30 cards for one and two-deck games, 35 for three-deck, and 40 for four-deck.
 - You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent's Wizard/Ringwraith is in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent's untap phase and then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgul permanent-event to do so. The hazard limit against all of your opponent's companies that turn is halved, rounded up.
 - Tapping a Nazgul to bring cards in from the sideboard does not turn the Nazgul into a short-event. It is discarded immediately upon declaration.
 - You may have Wizards in your sideboard. You may have no more than three copies of one Wizard, and one copy of each other Wizard, in your sideboard and play deck combined.
 - You may access your sideboard when your opponent plays The Lidless Eye as if he had revealed his Ringwraith.

#### Site

 - To untap a site the character doing so must be at that site.
 - A permanent-event played on a site affects only the copy of the site it is played on, unless otherwise specified. A permanent-event not played on a site affects all versions of affected sites.
 - Hero events cannot target or affect minion sites, and vice versa. _News of the Shire is an exception_.

#### Site Path
 - Certain cards refer to the site's site path. The site's site path is always the site path given on the site card, regardless of how the company got to that site.
 - Events can alter both a site's site path and a company's site path.

#### Skill Cards
 - Two or more skill cards may be played by a single character outside of the strike sequence.
 - Two skill cards may not be declared by one character against a given strike.
 - "(Foo) only" cards can only be played by characters with the (foo) skill.

#### Specific

 - To play a name-specific card, you must have declared yourself as the character with that name. That character need not be in play.

#### Stage Resources

 - If your opponent is playing the same Fallen-wizard as you, and reveals that Fallen-wizard first, you must discard any Fallen-wizard specific stage resources that you have in play.
 - Wizard specific Stage Resources may be played with the starting company.
 - Stored stage resources give stage points, and may be discarded normally.
 - If you start with _Hidden Haven_, you must bring out your stating site when you reveal _Hidden Haven_.

#### Stored Cards
 - Stored cards are not considered to be in play, except for uniqueness.
 - Stored cards get no bonuses based on who bears them.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Stage Resource.

### -= TTT =-

#### Targets
 - A target is an entity that an action is played out through. Enitities are only targets of an action if the action specifies those entities by number and type. Note that "the foo" counts as specifying one "foo."
 - **Annotation 1**: A card is not in play until it is resolved in its chain of effects. When the play of a card is declared, no elements of the card may be the target of actions declared in the same chain of effects. An exception to this is a dice-rolling action, e.g. a corruption check.
 - **Annotation 2**: A corruption check or any dice-rolling action can be targeted in the chain of effects during which it was declared.
 - **Annotation 3**: Long-events and certain other cards do not have targets because they are not played out through one specific entity, i.e., they generally affect an entire class of things.
 - **Annotation 4**: An action may not target a face-down card nor any element of a face down card. Face down cards include unrevealed new site cards and on-guard cards.
 - You cannot target an opponent's character or resources with your own resources.
 - A card that is played on a card continuously targets the card it is on.
 - See also Rulings by Term, Active Condition.

#### Timing
 - The validity of an effect, including the hazard limit, is checked upon declaration and upon resolution.
 - **Annotation 24**: If a card specifies that more than one action occurs when the card itself is resolved in a chain of effects, all of these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed.
 - (amendment to original version of Annotation 24): As an exception, if one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the attack, cancel one of its strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the strike sequence---see Annotation 18 (Turn Sequence, Movement/ Hazard Phase, Combat, Strike Sequence).
 - **Annotation 27**: If a card has optional effects, the player playing the card must choose which will take place. He must do this at the time the card is played, not when it is resolved in its chain of effects. When such a card is resolved, if any active conditions for the choice of effects do not exist, the card has no effect and is discarded. The player may not at this point choose to implement an alternative effect of the card.

#### Trophies

 - Creatures whose marshalling points are listed with an \* give marshalling points while used as trophies.
 - Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies, including Dragon factions.
 - Trophies can be discarded to satisfy "thieving" attacks, and count as items for all other effects.
 - Characters may not be taken as trophies
 - Trophies in Fallen-wizard companies give prowess and influence bonuses based on the MPs printed on the card.

### -= UUU =-

#### Under-deeps

 - Marshalling points with companies at or moving from an Under-deeps site do not count for the purposes of calling the Free Council. They do count at the Council. This includes minion and Fallen-wizard companies.
 - When a company's site of origin is an Under-deeps site and the company reveals a new site at the start of its movement/hazard phase, the company is declaring it will make a roll to determine if the movement was successful. No cards can be played between the site being revealed and the roll except for _Reach of Ulmo_. Neither player draws cards for this movement if the roll is not successful.
 - At an Under-deeps site, after a successful rescue attempt, a character can tap for a minor item only.
 - Automatic-attacks that allow the revealing of creature cards are not stopped by _Stealth_ or _Secret Entrance_.
 - Creatures revealed as automatic-attacks do not count as creatures.
 - @ With the addition of the sites in _Middle-earth: The Balrog_, Windthrone is now always a surface site of an underdeeps.

### -= WWW =-

#### Wizard
 - \# You may put two of the same Wizard in your deck, or you may put one copy each of two different Wizards in your deck.

#### Wizardhaven
 - A Wizardhaven is not considered to be adjacent to an Under-deeps site unless Deep Mines has been played on it.
 - Protected Wizardhavens do not allow you to move an extra region with region movement.
 - The phrase 'protected Wizardhaven' is just a keyword, and has no effect by itself.
 - If you are influencing against your opponent, and he is at a Wizardhaven where you can not play cards that give MPs, you can reveal the card you are influencing against to reduce the number you roll against to 0, but you may not play that card afterwards (if it gives MPs).

#### The Character Draft
 - The starting character pool consists of 10 characters.
 - Each player reveals one character at a time from their pool, simultaneously with their opponent. Non-duplicated characters go into the starting companies, duplicated characters are put aside and not allowed in either starting company.

 - Each deck must contain at least 12 creatures.
 - The following count as 1/2 a creature for deck construction: hazards that can be played as creatures or events, At Home Dragon manifestations, Ahunt Dragon manifestations, and agents. Note that agents count as characters in Ringwraith decks, not as 1/2 creatures.
 - Up to 3 copies of one Wizard or Ringwraith is allowed in a play deck, or up to 2 copies of one and 1 copy of another. One copy each of three different Wizards or Ringwraiths is not allowed.
 - You may place Ringwraiths or Wizards in your sideboard, as long as only one of them is duplicated in the deck and sideboard combined, and you have only Ringwraiths or only Wizards in the deck and sideboard combined.
 - You may include hero items in a Ringwraith deck even in a Ringwraith vs. Ringwraith game.
 - A Fallen-wizard may only count two _Twilights_ as resources, the third must be counted as a hazard. The same goes for other hazards that may be played as resources.
 - The two starting minor items must be chosen before the character draft, and must be the same for every game in the tournament.

#### Freeze the Flesh
 - If used on your Ringwraith or Fallen-wizard, it will remove the -5 MP penalty for having them eliminated.

#### Great Secrets Buried There
 - If you play this card as a hazard on your opponent, you must be able to provide your opponent with a copy of any uncommon Under-deeps sites if he does not have a copy in his location deck.
 - If you give an Under-deeps site to your opponent, it will return to your location deck when he is done with it, unless you have also used the site, in which case it returns to your discard pile.

#### Movement
 - Maps of the regions of _MECCG_ may be used in place of region cards in Council of Lorien tournaments. If two or more companies move on the same turn, then each company does not have to determine the site path to its new site until the beginning of it's movement/hazard phase.
 - Wizard companies cannot use starter movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth. If using region movement to or from sites in Gorgoroth, they must move from a site in Imlad Morgul, through either Nurn or Udun, or use a movement enhancer like _Ash Mountains_ or _Eagle-mounts_. Such sites may be reached normally with Under-deeps movement.

#### Sites
 - If you play a hazard forcing a Fallen-wizard to change site alignments, and he does not have the other version of the site he is moving to, you must provide it for him. After that it is his responsibility to provide sites.

#### Starting Companies
 - Ringwraith/Sauron players may have starting companies at Dol Guldur and/or Minas Morgul.
 - A Ringwraith may also be brought into play at Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul, or his home site.

#### Victory Conditions
 - Eliminating a Wizard or Ringwraith does not end the game.
 - An eliminated Wizard or Ringwraith is placed in the out-of-play pile, and gives -5 MP to the final total. That player may not reveal another Wizard or Ringwraith. This includes Wizards who fail corruption checks. \[effective 1/1/98]
 - The -5 MPs apply immediately, and affect your MPs for calling the end fo the game.
 - If your Fallen-wizard dies, you may not play cards specific to that Fallen-wizard, and you do not count as that Fallen-wizard for card effects such as _Gatherer of Loyalties_.

#### The Weakest Link Method
 - If there is a tie at the Free Council, add one corruption point to each non-Wizard character in play. All characters then make corruption checks. After all corruption checks, recount marshalling points.
 - Continue this until there is no longer a tie or until all non-Wizard characters are corrupted away.

## Rulings Monday

Rulings for the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_ fall into two categories now. First are those which cover ambiguous situations, and those rulings take effect immediately. Second are those which reverse previous rulings, introduce new rulings on non-ambiguous situations, and errata. These rulings will not take effect in tournament play for two to four weeks.

Every other Monday, all rulings of the second type, made in the past two weeks, will be announced. Also, with each announcement will come a list of rulings which are effective starting that Monday.

#### Rulings Effective 10/26/98
 - _Windlord Found Me_: This resources requires that you tap a character to play it. You may not play it directly to your M.P. pile.

#### Rulings Effective 10/12/98
 - _Padding Feet_: Card Erratum: Change the first sentence to read: “…at the same site as an opponent’s Hobbit”

#### Rulings Effective 4/20/98
 - _Deep Mines_, Card Erratum: Add "Cannot be duplicated on a given Wizardhaven."

#### Rulings Effective 2/9/98
 - _Open to the Summons_, Card Erratum: Change "Playable on a minion company" to "Playable on a company."

#### Rulings Effective 1/26/98
 - The _MEWH_ hand rules need errata. They should read that "a Fallen-wizard must not use starter movement," not that they may only use region movement. This means they can use Under-deeps movement, and cards like _Belegaer_.
 - Forcing a dice roll is considered to be having an effect on the game. This means you can play _Muster_ or _Weariness of the Heart_, even if there is no chance of the card doing anything.

#### Rulings Effective 12/6/97
 - Agents count as both characters and hazards during the game in a Ringwraith deck.

#### Rulings Effective 12/1/97
 - _No Escape from My Magic_, Card Erratum: Change "Playable on any faction in play" to "Playable on any unique faction in play."
 - Ringwraiths may not move from a non-Darkhaven site to another non-Darkhaven site unless they are using _Dwar Unleashed_. This means a Ringwraith may not move to Under-deeps sites that do not have a Darkhaven for a surface site.

#### Rulings Effective 11/17/97
 - Removing the site of origin and resetting to hand size are simultaneous actions, and they are the last actions in any movement/hazard phase. This means a moving company is not at a site until the site phase.
 - Some hazard permanent-events allow you to tap or discard them for an effect, and this does not count against the hazard limit unless specified otherwise on the card.
 - Rules Erratum: Attacks keyed to Darkhavens are detainment.
 - _Gates of Morning_ discards hazard environments when it resolves, even if _Peril Returned_ is in play.
 - _Iron Shield of Old_: Card Erratum: Add "_Shield._"

#### Rulings Effective 11/3/97
 - If a card leaves active play, including being returned to a player's hand, it immediately ceases having an effect on play.
 - _Stay Her Appetite_: Card Erratum: Change "plus two" to "plus five."
