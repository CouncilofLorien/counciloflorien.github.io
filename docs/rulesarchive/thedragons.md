MIDDLE-EARTH: THE DRAGONS

This insert provides expansion rules, clarifications, and a scenario for use with both _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) and _Middle-earth: The Dragons_ (_METD_). These rules are recommended for all _METW_ games even if _METD_ is not used.

## KEY WORDS AND TERMS (_Clarification_)

A "key word" is an identifier for a card which makes it affectable by or usable with other cards as the cards' text dictate. For example, in _METW_, key words include: Orc, spell, environment, Dragon, Undead, Wolves, etc.

_Middle-earth: The Dragons_ introduces several "key words" to the Middle-earth collectible card game: Drake, light enchantment, dark enchantment, ritual, riddling attempt, riddling roll , offering attempt, flattery attempt, capture, and helmet. There are no special rules for these key words; except that a character may only use the effects of one helmet at a time. Note that the key words, Dragon and Drake, are mechanically independent. Some of the key words are not affected by any currently existing cards (e.g., offering attempt and capture), but they will be with the release of future expansions.

A "bearer" of a specific card refers to the character that bears or controls that card.

## DRAGON LAIRS

Any site with a Dragon automatic-attack is a Dragon's lair. There are nine unique Dragons associated with the following lairs:

| Dragon | Lair (site) | Lair's Region | 
| ---: | :---: | :--- |
Agburanar |  Caves of Ulund  |  Withered Heath
Bairanax  | Ovir Hollow  |  Grey Mountain Narrows
Daelomin  |  Dancing Spire | Withered Heath
Earcaraxe  | Isle of the Ulond  |  Andrast Coast
Itangast |  Gold Hill  | Withered Heath
Leucaruth  | Irerock  |  Withered Heath
Scatha  |  Gondmaeglom  |  Grey Moumain Narrows
Scorba  | Zarak Dum  | Angmar
Smaug  |  The Lonely Mountain  |  Northern Rhovanion

## HOARDS

Certain items are hoard items. Such an item may only be played at a site that contains a hoard. Each site with a Dragon automatic-attack (i.e., each Dragon's lair) contains a hoard. A hoard minor item may not be included with a starting company, and may not be played at a site that does not contain a hoard.

{: .note }
> **Example:** You can not play a hoard minor item at Wellinghall after successfully influencing the _Ents of Fangorn_ like you can with a normal minor item. Wellinghall does not contain a hoard.

## MANIFESTATIONS OF DRAGONS

Each of the nine unique Dragons (see above) has three different manifestations:

**Basic** — In this manifestation a Dragon is in his standard active mode. Each of these manifestations is represented by a standard creature
card (e.g., the cards for Smaug, Agburanar, Daelomin, and Leucaruth from _METW_).

**Ahunt** — In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to be hunting in a wide range of regions. Each of these manifestations is represented by a hazard long-event that will attack any company moving in a given set of regions (e.g., _Smaug Ahunt_ normally causes an attack against any company moving in Withered Heath, Northern Rhovanion, Iron Hills, and/or Grey Mountain Narrows).

**At Home** — In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to be resident in his lair. Each of these manifestations is represented by a hazard permanent-event that gives its lair an additional automatic-attack and causes certain other global effects (e.g., _Scorba At Home_ gives Zarak Dum an additional automatic-attack and each major item gives an additional corruption point).

Different manifestations of the same Dragon may be in play at the same time. The fact that each manifestation is unique unto itself does not preclude the other manifestations.

Only your opponent can receive marshalling points from defeating a manifestation of a Dragon that you played. If you defeat a Dragon manifestation that you played, it is removed from the game and no one receives its marshalling points.
