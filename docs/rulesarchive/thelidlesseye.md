# MIDDLE-EARTH: THE LIDLESS EYE

{: .text-center }
***"And into the heart of the storm,<br>with a cry that pierced all other sounds.<br>Tearing the clouds asunder, the Nazgul came…"<br>"…and all were branded with the foul token of the Lidless Eye…"***

# INTRODUCTION

During the Third Age, Sauron the Dark Lord returned and threatened to enslave all of Middle-earth. However, having been defeated and almost destroyed in the Second Age, Sauron hesitated—he wanted to restore himself to full power before starting his final assault on the Free Peoples. This meant he needed to marshal overwhelming tactical and strategic resources: and, if possible, he needed to recover the lost reservoir of his vast might, The One Ring.

Sauron wanted to remain in the safety of Barad-Dur, in the center of his web of control. So his chief tools for gathering resources were his Ringwraiths the nine Nazgul. While Sauron could automatically exert control over any Nazgul, the Nazgul maintained a large amount of independence and free will—they were of little use to Sauron without it.

In _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye (MELE)_, you play one of these nine Ringwraiths, the Nazgul. Your goal is to marshal enough resources so that the Dark Lord will be confident enough to send you and your armies to launch the first blow necessary to crush the Free Peoples. Since your fellow Ringwraiths do not agree on how best to accomplish this goal (and of course none are as worthy as you), you must compete with them to be the first to gather enough forces to gain the Dark Lord's confidence. If your opponent has access to _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) cards, you will also be able to play a Ringwraith against a Wizard.

In _The Lord of the Rings_, the Witch-king of Angmar was the first Ringwraith to succeed. Sauron dispatched him and his armies to destroy Gondor. However, due to a subtle twist of fate, he fell on the brink of victory, not against a "man" of great power, but against a woman (Eowyn) and a single Hobbit (Merry).
 
"Dangerous forces" in _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_ are represented by _hazards_ that the players use against one another. For example, if you move a character into the Lonely Mountain, your opponent could play a Dragon card as a hazard. These hazards are not "controlled" by the Ringwraiths, but rather they represent the dangerous forces that are abroad in Middle-earth, threatening everyone, good and evil characters alike. All Ringwraiths are working to bring Sauron to full power, so conflict takes the form of hazards and direct attempts to "persuade" or "dominate" each other and each other's characters and forces, rather than the form of direct conflict.
 
## USING THIS RULESBOOK
 
These rules are organized into five sections: the Starter Rules, the Standard Rules, the Optional Rules, Using _MELE_ with _METW_, and the Appendices. The Starter and Standard Rules are for a two-player game; multi-player rules are provided in the Optional Rules.

The "Using _MELE_ with _METW_" section contains the essential rules for integrating _METW_ cards with _MELE_. The Full Player Turn Summary provided on pages 92-94 is a great reference for getting started

{: .note }
> **Note:** The rules for _MELE_ are very similar to the rules for _Middle-earth: The Wizards_. Passages with major rule differences are marked with a line of bullets as a sidebar (just as this paragraph is marked[^bullets]). Experienced players of _METW_ can examine these passages and proceed with playing.

_The Starter Rules_ — The Starter Rules contain all of the guidelines you need to play _MELE_. They have been designed to simplify teaching the game and to speed up play. You should use the Starter Rules if you and your opponent have never played this game before.<br>If you are already an experienced player of collectible card games, you might initially read the Full Player Turn Summary on pages 92-94 **and** the sections that are not boxed. Then, as you play, you can refer to the other material that details the more complex rules and situations that may arise during play.

_The Standard Rules_ — These rules assume you have already played several games using the Starter Rules. The Standard Rules consist of additions and extensions to the Starter Rules that make play and deck building more flexible, exciting, and interesting. We recommend that experienced _MELE_ players use all of the Standard Rules.

_The Optional Rules_ — Interesting variations to the standard rules. Before play begins, both players must agree on which optional rules are to be used.

_Using MELE with METW_ — These guidelines explain how play proceeds when one player is a Ringwraith and one player is a Wizard. This section also describes how to integrate cards (usually hazards) from _METW_ (and vice versa) even if both players are Ringwraiths (or Wizards).

_The Appendices_ — This section contains a Full Player Turn Summary, a glossary, a color insert with card keys and a Middle-earth map (see the center of this book), and conventions of tournament play. These conventions of tournament play are also widely adopted for casual play.
 
{: .note }
> **Note:** _MELE_ is a collectible card game—each player usually has a large number of _MELE_ cards available, but only a limited number are used in any one game. Before each game, a player must choose the cards he will use for that game. This process is referred to as "deck construction." Often deck construction is just as important (if not more important) than actual play.
 
## BRIEF PLAYER TURN SUMMARY
 
Play consists of a series of "Player Turns." During your turn, follow the steps outlined in this turn summary. Then, your opponent does the same during his turn. You and your opponent alternate turns until the game ends. 

This brief player turn summary is included here to give you a very basic idea of how play proceeds; refer to pages 92-94 for the Full Player Turn Summary.

_Untap Phase_ — Heal (if at a Darkhaven site) **or** untap your characters and other tapped non-site cards.

_Organization Phase_ — You may play a character, reorganize your companies, transfer/store items, and decide where each of your companies is going to move.

_Long-event Phase_ — Remove and play certain "long-event" cards.

_Movement/Hazard Phase_ — You may move each of your companies to its new site, while your opponent plays hazards on each of your companies.

_Site Phase_ — You may have each of yourcompanies enter its current site to attempt to play an item, ally, faction, etc.

_End-of-Turn Phase_ — Your turn ends.
 
{: .note }
> **Note:** For purposes of readability, these rules use the standard masculine pronouns when referring to a person of uncertain gender. In such cases, these pronouns are intended to convey the meanings: she/he, him/her, etc.


# • PART I •<br>STARTER RULES

To get a general idea of how to play, read the Starter Rules sections that are not boxed. Later you can refer to the boxed sections for more information on special situations.

{: .note }
> **Note:** These rules apply to a Ringwraith player playing a Ringwraith player. See Part IV (page 73) for guidelines for handling a game between a Ringwraith and a Wizard.
> 
> **Note:** In _MELE_ you will draw multiple cards each turn, and in some cases you will have to discard a number of cards each turn. Don't let this worry you, it's part of the flow of play. Just keep cards that are immediately useful during the next turn **or** that are crucial to your overall strategy.

#### Random Values

Two six-sided dice (2D6) should be used to generate random values during play. This is called “making a roll.” To make a roll, roll 2D6 and add the two results together.

{: .note }
> **Note:** If dice are not available, a random value can be generated by drawing a card from your play deck. Each card in a play deck has a number on the right side just below the center. You can use this number as the random value, then discard the card. **Do not use this method if dice are available!**

## THE VICTORY CONDITIONS

The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:
 1. If your Ringwraith is "eliminated" (i.e., fails a body check)—your opponent wins.
 2. If you move _The One Ring_ to Barad-dur—Sauron is reunited with _The One Ring_ and you win. (See page 44 for more on Rings).
 3. Otherwise, the winner is decided at the _Audience with Sauron_.<br>This audience is called when one of the following occurs:
 - When each play deck has been exhausted once, the audience starts at the end of the current turn.
 - If your play deck has been exhausted _and_ you play a _Sudden Call_ card as a **resource** during one of your turns, the audience starts following your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).
 - If you have at least 20 marshalling points _and_ you play a _Sudden Call_ card as a **resource** during one of your turns, the audience starts following your opponent's next turn (i.e., your opponent gets one last turn).

{: .note }
> **Note:** In the Standard Game, you may use a _Sudden Call_ card as a Hazard to cause the Audience with Sauron to be called (see page 54).
> 
> **Note:** If one or both players only has access to a starter deck (76 cards), this requirement of 20 marshaling points should be lowered to 18.
 
### THE AUDIENCE WITH SAURON
 
Just before the Audience With Sauron, each non-Ringwraith character must make a corruption check. The player who took the last turn makes corruption checks for his characters first. 
 
At the audience, Sauron decides which Ringwraith has been the most successfuly and will deliver the first massive blow against the Free Peoples. This is based upon a comparison of the resources each of the Ringwraiths has marshalled.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Characters do not automatically untap when the audience is called. A character may only untap during his own untap phase.
> 
> **Clarification:** A character that fails his corruption check by two or more prior to the Audience With Sauron is eliminated. That character and any non-follower cards he controls are not available at the Audience With Sauron—thus, they do not count towards the marshalling point totals.<br>A player may play resource cards that can affect his characters’ corruption checks made prior to the audience. Hazard cards may _not_ be played.
 
The winner of the game is the player that has gathered the most marshalling points from:
 - Control of resources: characters, allies, items, and factions.
 - Defeating certain creatures.
 - Carrying out the instructions on resource cards.
 
Marshalling  points are printed on the top left corner of the cards that award them.
                                        
{: .note }
> **Note:** You may find it useful to use pencil and paper or extra dice to keep a running total of marshalling points.
> 
> **Clarification:** If both players have the same number of marshalling points at the Audience with Sauron, the game ends in a tie.

{: .note }
> **Example:** Our two players are Wendy and Nick. Wendy has 20 marshalling points and Nick only had 18. During her turn, Wendy plays a _Sudden Call_ card—Sauron calls the audience. Each player has one company in Carn Dum (CP = Corruption Points. MP = Marshalling Points):
>
> | Wendy Controls: | CPs | MPs |
> | :------------- | ---: | ---: |
> | Orcs of Angmar (faction) | 0 | 2 |
> | Beornings (faction) | 0 | 3 |
> | Sieze Prisoners (miscellaneous) | 0 | 2 |
> | _Dwar the Ringwraith_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 0 | 0 | 
> | &emsp; The Warg-king (ally) | 0 | 2 |
> | _Troll-chief_ (controls:)  | Total CPs: 5 | 2 |
> | &emsp; Black Mace (item) | 3 | 2 |
> | &emsp; Magic Ring of Fury (item) | 2 | 2 |
> | _Troll Lout_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 1 | 1  |
> | &emsp; Saw-toothed Blade (item) | 1 | 0 |
> | _Shagrat_ (controls:) | 0 | 2 |
> | _Grisnakh_ (controls:) | 0 | 1 |
> | _Orc Tracker_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 1 | 1 |
> | &emsp; Orc-liquor | 2 | 0 |
>      
> | Nick Controls: | CPs | MPs |
> | :------------- | ---: | ---: |
> | _Indur the Ringwraith_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 0 | 0 |
> | _Ciryaher_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 0 | 2 |
> | _Tarcil_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 5 | 2 |
> | &emsp; Palantir of Orthanc (item) | 3 | 3 |
> | &emsp; Magic Ring of Enigma (item) | 2 | 2  |
> | _Orc Captain_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 2 | 2 |
> | &emsp; Saw-toothed Blade (item) | 1 | 0 |
> | &emsp; Foul-smelling Paste (item) | 1 | 0 |
> | _Lieutenant of Morgul_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 0 | 3 |
> |  &emsp; Stinker (ally) | 0 | 2 |
> | _Orc Captain_ (controls:) | Total CPs: 0 | 2 |
> 
> Since Wendy played the _Sudden Call_ card, Nick gets one final turn. Nick moves his company to Cameth Brin. After facing hazards, he plays the _Hillmen_ faction for 4 more MPs. Nick now has 22 MPs and will win the game if he does not lose MPs due to characters failing corruption checks.
> 
> In this example, any character with 4 or more corruption points (the Troll-chief and Tarcil) could fail his corruption check (see pages 35-38 for a detailed explanation and example of corruption checks). If the Troll-chief fails his corruption check, Wendy loses 6 of her MPs. If Tarcil fails his corruption check, Nick loses 7 of his MPs.

## 2 • THE CARDS AND DECKS

There are four types of cards: site cards, character cards (including Ringwraith cards), resource cards, hazard cards.

{: .note }
> **Note:** Color diagrams of the various types of cards can be found in the color insert. The card types can be distinguished as follows:
> 
> _Site cards_ have a grey parchment background on the front.
> 
> _Character cards_ (non-Ringwraith) have a rusted-purplish iron background on the front. Each Ringwraith card has a blood-red stone background. 
> 
> _Resource cards_ have a grey-blue steel background on the front.
> 
> _Hazard cards_ have a steel grey metal background on the front.
> 
> _Site cards_ (i.e., location cards) have a map of Middle-earth on the back.
> 
> _Character_, _resource_, and _hazard cards_ have the burning eye on the back.
> 
> **Note:** _MELE_ doesn't include region cards. If you have _METW_ region cards, you can use region movement as outlined on page 78.
> 
> **Clarification:** For emphasis, a value used during play is often provided both in a card’s text and in another place on the same card. For example, a character’s corruption check modification is stated both in the text and the lower right corner of the character’s card.
> 
> **Note:** Each starter deck has a small pack of cards called a fixed set. There are 5 fixed sets in all. One appears randomly in each starter deck. The top facing card of all fixed sets is a Ringwraith and is different for each fixed set and can be seen through the window of the starter deck box.
> 
> A fixed set is included in each starter deck to make a starter deck playable without any other cards.

{: .text-center }
![](/assets/images/cardsanddecks.svg)

During play, your cards are organized into 2 decks and 3 piles:

_Location Deck_ — This deck consists of your site cards. You may examine and select cards from your location deck as required by play (i.e., do not randomly draw them). After being played, your non-Haven site cards are sometimes discarded and placed in the discard pile (i.e., when one of your companies leaves a tapped site, it is discarded).

{: .note }
> **Note:** Site cards and regions represent the geography of Middle-earth. They are used to control the acquisition of resources. Each turn, examine the resources in your hand and select a nearby site to travel to. Do not worry too much about which site to use, just pick one that has the resource type you want to play. It also helps if you preselect the location cards you are most likely to use. See the color insert for a map of Middle-earth.

_Play Deck_ — This deck consists of your resource cards, hazards cards, and character cards. You randomly draw cards from this deck during play. Your play deck starts with an equal number of resource cards and hazard cards.<br>You can use resources at certain sites and under certain conditions. Resources include: items, factions, allies, events, etc. _You may only play resource cards during your own turn_. You use hazards to hinder and attack your opponent’s characters in order to prevent them from marshalling resources. _You may only play hazard cards during your opponent’s movement/hazard phase_.

{: .note} 
> **Clarification:** The card, _Twilight_, is an exception to this rule—it can be played at anytime, either as a resource or as a hazard (it does not count against the hazard limit). Certain other cards specifically state when they may be played.

_Discard Pile_ — Your discarded cards are placed face down in your discard pile. When your play deck is _exhausted_, location cards in your discard pile are returned to your location deck. You shuffle the other cards in your discard pile and they become your new play deck.

{: .note} 
> **Clarification:** Your play deck is “exhausted” when you draw its last card. Some cards require that your play deck be manipulated and then reshuffled—this does **not** “exhaust” your play deck.

_Out-of-play Pile_ — Your cards that are removed from play after being used are placed in your out-of-play pile. 

_Marshalling Point Pile_ (_MP pile_) — In addition to marshalling points from active cards in play, you gain marshalling points when certain cards become inactive. When you store certain resource cards (e.g., items, information cards, etc.), they are placed in your MP pile. When you defeat all of the strikes from a creature that has its MPs marked with an "\*" in the upper-left corner of its card, the creature’s card is placed in your MP pile.

{: .note }
> **Note:** When you defeat all of the strikes from a creature that does _not_ have an "\*" next to its MP value in the upper-left corner of its card, the creature's card is **not** placed in your MP pile, it is placed in your opponent's out-of-play pile. Unlike _METW_, you do not get MPs for defeating certain creatures—after all, many creatures are fighting the Free People too.
>
>  **Note:** Because hazard cards are distinct from resource cards, you may not play your hazards on your side of the playing surface. _At the end of a game, it will be obvious whose cards are whose, i.e., hazards in your area must belong to your opponent_. We suggest adopting a neutral zone between each player’s side of the playing surface. Non-targeted long-events and permanent-events can be played in this neutral zone.
> 
> **Note:** You may freely examine the contents of your discard pile; your opponent may not. The contents of your out-of-play and marshalling point piles may be freely examined by you and your opponent.
> 
> **Clarification:** If a character is eliminated due to combat or due to failing a corruption check, his card is placed in the out-of-play pile—that character may not be brought back into play by either player.<br>When a card is removed from play in all other cases, the card is discarded unless the card specifically states otherwise.
> 
> **Clarification:** In general, cards in your out-of-play pile and your marshalling point pile are considered to be actively in play for the purposes of being unique (if the card states it is unique).

### KEYWORDS

Several types of cards are referred to by the key word included in the first few words of a card’s text. For example, the text of a “spirit-magic” card starts with _Magic. Spirit-magic_; the text of a “wolf” card starts with _Wolves_; the text of a “Palantír” starts with _Unique. Palantir_.

Keywords do not necessarily carry any rules (though some do like _Unique_ and _Corruption_). Keywords are used to determine if an effect in the game affects a card.

### CARD COMBINATIONS

Often combinations of several cards and other actions are required to achieve a desired result. For example, to bring _The One Ring_ into play requires: traveling to a site to play one of the Gold Ring cards, some sort of “Test” card or ability, _The One Ring_ card, and a high die roll. In addition, the _Scroll of Isildur_ card will improve the chances of successfully getting _The One Ring_ into play.

### TAPPING AND CARD POSITIONS

Normally, during play, each of your cards is placed on the playing surface so that its top is towards your opponent and its bottom is towards you. During play certain cards must be “tapped” when they are used—this is a record keeping mechanism to keep track of card usage. To tap a card, rotate it 90˚ so that it is turned sideways—to untap a card, rotate it back 90˚ to its normal position. 

When one of your characters is wounded, his card is placed with its top towards you (i.e., rotated 180˚ from an untapped position). All restrictions to tapped characters also apply to wounded characters. 

{: .note }
> **Note:** At any given time during play, each character in play must be in one of the three "states:" he must be either untapped, tapped, or wounded.
> 
> **Clarification:** A tapped (or wounded) character can perform any action that does not require the character to tap. For example, a tapped (or wounded) character can move normally, he can fight with a penalty (if the attacker chooses him as the target of a strike), he can transfer items, etc. A tapped (or wounded) character may **not** tap to acquire an item, to influence a faction, to play a card requiring that he tap, etc.<br>Items and characters tap independently.

### UNIQUE & “MAY NOT BE DUPLICATED” CARDS

If a card states that it is “unique” or that it “may not be duplicated,” only one such card (or its effects) may be in play at a time. The first card played takes precedence (influence checks may change this). This restriction applies to all cards in play, i.e., both yours and your
opponent’s.

Only one of each “unique” card may be included in your play deck and starting cards combined. As an exception, two of the same Ringwraith may be included in your play deck (to give you a better chance of drawing one early).

{: .note }
> If a unique card is eliminated, that card may not be brought back into play by either player.

## 3 • GETTING READY TO PLAY

Follow these steps to get ready to play:

 1. Place your site cards in your location deck. This deck should contain all of your Darkhaven cards (i.e., Minas Morgul, Dol Guldur, Carn Dum, and Geann a-Lisch). You may include any number of Darkhaven cards, but only one of each non-Haven site card.
 2. Place between 25 and 50 Resource cards **and** an equal number of Hazard cards in your play deck (if you have fewer than 25 of either available, just use all of the cards you have). Only one of each “unique” card may be included. No more than three copies of any one non-unique card may be included.
 3. Place one to fix starting characters (no Wizards) face down in front of you. The combined mind attributes (see [page 18]()) of these characters must be 20 or less. You and your opponent reveal your characters simultaneously, placing any duplicated characters into your play decks. Then organize your starting characters into followers and companies and place them at Minas Morgul (i.e., place a Minas Morgul site card next to them).
 4. You _may_ assign up to two non-unique minor items to your starting characters (i.e., 2 items total, **not** 2 to each character). These items must come from cards that you have not committed to your play deck.
 5. Place up to 10 character cards in your play deck. Only one of each character card may be included. In addition, place up to two Ringwraith cards in your play deck (you may place two copies of the same Wizard). Shuffle your play deck.
 6. Draw a hand of eight cards from your play deck.
 7. Each player makes a roll, and the player with the highest result goes first (reroll if tied).
 
{: .note } 
> **Clarification:** None of your starting characters may be considered to be followers for the purposes of determining their combined mind attributes. That is, these characters have to have combined mind attributes of 20 or less. 
> 
> **Clarification:** The initial 1-6 characters and two minor items do count toward the “one-unique” and “three-others” limits on the play deck. However, they do **not** count towards the number of resource and character cards in your starting play deck.

## 4 • THE PLAYER TURN

Play consists of a series of “Player Turns.” During your turn, you take various actions during the following phases. Then, your opponent does the same during his turn.

 1. Untap Phase 
 2. Organization Phase 
 3. Long-event Phase 
 4. Movement/Hazard Phase
 5. Site Phase
 6. End-of-Turn Phase

A detailed Full Player Turn Summary is presented on [p. 92-94]().

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The actions that may be taken during your organization phase may be taken in any order (e.g., you can store an item, then bring a character into play, and then store a second item).
> 
> **Clarification:** You may play a site (i.e., move to a site) that your opponent previously used or is currently using.
> 
> **Clarification:** If one of your companies doesn’t move, neither player draws cards based on that company’s movement. However, your opponent can play still play allowable hazards on that company (hazard limit still applies). 
> 
> **Clarification:** During the site phase, a company may decide not to enter and explore its current site. In this case, the company does not face the automatic-attack, but it may not take any other actions or play any cards during the site phase. The company remains at the site and it may decide to enter the site on a later turn.
> 
> **Clarification:** Before a company can attempt to play one item, ally, faction, or other card that is “playable” at its current site, it must face the site’s automatic-attacks. The company need not defeat the attacks, it merely needs to resolve the attacks normally (such attacks could be canceled).<br>A company can face a site’s automatic-attacks and still not play a card (e.g., all of its characters are tapped after facing the automatic-attacks). If such a company wants to play a card at the site on a later turn, it must face the automatic-attacks again. 
> 
> **Clarification:** A site taps when one item, ally, or faction card is played at that site. The play of certain other resource cards may tap sites—such a card will specifically state that playing it taps the site. Non-Darkhaven sites only normally untap after being discarded and after your play deck is exhausted. So, each time through your play deck, only one such card may normally be played at a given non-Darkhaven site. Darkhaven cards, whether tapped or not, always return to your location deck untapped.

## 5 • CHARACTERS & COMPANIES

As a player, you influence and control a number of characters that move and act in the world of Middle-earth. Each character’s abilities are defined by these attributes: race, skills, direct influence, prowess (offense), body (defense), mind, marshalling points, and special abilities (e.g., corruption check modifiers). A character can be _eliminated_ and removed from play as a result of combat (failing a body check) or corruption (failing a corruption check).

If you have enough general influence or direct influence during a given turn, you may bring into play: one non-Ringwraith character at his home site or at any Darkhaven **or** your Ringwraith at his home site or Minas Morgul (see page 20). 

Characters are primarily controlled by your pool of 20 general influence points. For each controlled character, you must commit a number of general influence points equal to his mind attribute. In addition, you may control a character by using another character’s direct influence—a character controlled in this fashion is called a _follower_ and does not use general influence points. (See [page 19]() for an extended example.)

During play, you may organize your characters into groups called companies. A company’s _size_ is equal to the number of characters in it. A company is limited to a size of seven. A company’s _hazard limit_ is equal to two or the size of the company, whichever is greater. The maximum number of hazards that can be played on a company during a given movement/hazard phase is equal to its hazard limit. 

Companies can only combine at a Darkhaven—just remove all but one of the companies’ Darkhaven site cards. The resulting company then has one site card consisting of a Darkhaven site card.

One company can split into two or more companies only at a Darkhaven (use two Darkhaven cards).

{: .note } 
> **Note:** The number of characters you have in play limits the number of actions you may take during a given turn. You use your other characters’ direct influence on a character to bring that character into play and to keep him in play. A character in play can move and take actions (e.g., defending against attacks, influencing, etc.). Items, allies, and other cards representing things a character acquires and controls are placed under his card.
> 
> **Note:** Sometimes two or more companies combine and the resulting company has two or more of the came cards that say: "cannot be duplicated on a given company." When this happens, immediately discard all but one of those cards (your choice). 
>
> **Clarification:** During your organization phase, one Darkhaven card may be used to represent the location of two or more companies, so long as the distinction between companies is clearly presented spatially. However, we suggest the use of multiple Darkhaven cards for clarity.
> 
> **Clarification:** Even if you have no characters in play, the game is not over. You may continue to draw and discard cards—eventually you will draw your Ringwraith or a character.
>
> **Note:** _MELE_ characters are different from _METW_ characters. When it is important to distinguish between the two types of characters, _MELE_ characters are referred to as "minions" (or minion characters) and _METW_ characters are referred to as "heroes" (or hero characters). See [pages 74-75]() for more information.
 
### CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES

Each character’s abilities are defined by the following attributes (the notation for certain attributes is given in brackets).

_Race:_ This is one criterion for using certain resources and for bringing certain items, characters, and factions into play (e.g., only a Dwarf can fully utilize a Dwarven Ring). The races are: Elf, Dwarf, Dunadan, Man, Orc, Troll, and Ringwraith.

_Skills:_ This is one of the criterion for using certain cards (e.g., warrior skill is required to use certain weapons). The skills are: warrior, scout, ranger, sage, and diplomat. Some characters have more than one skill.

_Direct Influence_ \[  ![](/assets/images/di.svg) ]: A character’s direct influence determines which of your characters he may control (i.e., have as followers). In addition, a character’s unused direct influence affects his chances of influencing factions and your opponent’s resources.

_Prowess_ \[lower left, to left of “/”]: A character’s prowess is a measure of a character’s offensive capabilities in combat.

_Body_ \[lower left, to right of “/”]: A character’s body is a measure of how difficult it is to physically eliminate the character. This is a mixture of the ability to avoid an attack and the ability to absorb or deflect an attack (e.g., armor, shield, blocking).

_Mind_ \[  ![](/assets/images/mind.svg) ]: A character’s mind determines how many influence points (a Ringwraith’s general influence points or a character’s direct influence points) are required to keep this character in play. Your Ringwraith has no mind and requires no influence to control.

_Marshalling Points_ \[ upper left ]: This is the number of marshalling points you receive when you have the character in play. This value represents the character’s importance to Sauron.

_Special Abilities:_ Some characters have special abilities that are detailed on their cards. Special abilities include corruption check modifiers, influence bonuses, and prowess bonuses. For example, Shamas has an influence bonus against the _Dunlending_ faction.

### INFLUENCING (CONTROLLING) A CHARACTER

You have a pool of 20 general influence points. At the end of your organization phase, the total mind attributes of your characters in play (not counting followers) must be less than or equal to 20; this total is equal to your _used general influence points_. Your _unused general influence points_ help your characters resist the effects of certain cards (e.g., _Call of Home_, _Muster Disperses_, etc.). 

{: .note } 
> **Note:** In the Standard Rules, your _unused general influence points_ help your characters, factions, allies, and items resist influence attempts made by your opponent.

#### Direct Influence

Some characters have a direct influence attribute of one or more. If such a character’s direct influence is greater than or equal to another one of your characters’ mind attribute, he may take control of that other character, who then becomes a _follower_ of the controlling character. These conditions must be met:
 - The total mind attributes of all of a character’s followers may not exceed his direct influence.
 - A character can take control of another character that is in play only if both characters are in the same company.
 
A follower does not require influence points from your general pool, and he must remain stacked under the character exerting the direct influence. A follower may not use his direct influence to control characters (i.e., a follower may not have his own followers). 

_A follower is handled in all other ways as a normal character_ (e.g., counts for company size, takes normal actions, etc.). 

If you have enough unused general influence points, you may move a follower from direct influence to general influence (or vice versa) during your organization phase.

If a character directly influencing a follower is removed from play, the follower remains in play and does not immediately count against general influence. However, during your next organization phase, you must discard the follower, place the follower under the control of another character in his company with enough available direct influence, or place the follower under the control of general influence (if enough is available).

{: .note } 
> **Example:** In this example and later examples, the notation “#•#” is used. The first number is the character’s mind attribute; the second is his direct influence (DI). A direct influence value in brackets applies only against certain types of characters (in this example, only against Orcs and Trolls). In our example from page 8, Wendy and Nick each have one company at Carn Dum (a Darkhaven) organized as follows:

> 
> Wendy’s company size is 6 and she has 5 unused general influence; Nicks’s company size is 6 and he has 0 unused general influence.

### BRINGING CHARACTERS INTO PLAY

During your organization phase, you may perform **one and only one** of the following activities:
 - You may play a non-Ringwraith character card. You must place him at his home site _or_ at any Darkhaven site. If you do not have enough general influence or direct influence to control the character by the end of your organization phase, then the character is returned to hand. You must place him at his home site or at any Darkhaven site.
 - You may play a Ringwraith card if you do not have one in play. This is called "Revealing Your Ringwraith." You may **not** reveal a Ringwraith if your opponent has already revealed that Ringwraith. You must place your Ringwraith at his home site or at Minas Morgul. You need not control a Ringwraith with influence—he represents you, the player. While revealing your Ringwraith is an advantage, it also carries with it the danger of losing the game by having your Ringwraith eliminated.

When you play a character, you may place him into a company already at his arrival site **or** he may become a new company (consisting of one character). In the second case, you must place the arrival site card next to the character played. If the appropriate site card is not available, you may not play the character.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Playing a character does **not** tap a site.

Most characters are unique. So if you already have a unique character in play, your opponent may not play the same character. Similarly, if a unique character has been eliminated, he may not be brought
into play again by either player. 

{: .note }
> **Example:** In the [p. 8]() example, Wendy calls the audience. Then Nick takes his final turn. His company is at a Darkhaven, so he may play a character during his organzation phase. Nick has Grishnakh and an Orc Tracker in his hand (each has a 3 mind attribute). Nick would like to play Grishnakh, but he is unique and Wendy already has him in play. The Orc Tracker is not unique, so Nick plays him. Nick has no unused general influence, so the Orc Tracker must be placed under the control of one of Nick's non-follower characters with at least 3 unused direct influence. Only Nick's non-follower Orc Captain meets these requirements.

### COMPANIES

A company is a group of characters that move and act together. This allows characters to move, act, and defend as a unit, allowing stronger characters to protect the weaker characters. This mechanism can be used to allow a variety of tactics during play. 

For example, if you have 3 characters in play, the 3 characters can move separately and perhaps do more in terms of acquiring marshalling points (items, other characters, etc.); but each individual character is more vulnerable to danger. However, the same 3 characters operating as a company might acquire marshalling points more slowly, but they are safer (i.e., you risk less).

Normally, a company is limited to a size of seven, but a company at a Darkhaven site may be of any size. For these purposes, an ally does not. The size of a company is determined for each company at the beginning of the movement/hazard phase (e.g., it remains fixed even if a character leaves the company).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A company is **not** an "attack," and a character is **note** an "attack." So hazards that modify attacks have no effect on characters and companies.

#### Limitations on Company Composition

Unless at a Darkhaven, a Ringwraith may not be in a company with other characters.

#### Overt and Covert Companies

The text for certain cards distinguish between overt companies and covert companies. Any company that contains a Ringwraith in _Fell Rider_ mode, an Orc, or a Troll is an overt company. Any other company is a covert company.

{: .note }
> **Note:** An overt company is readily identifiable as an evil force (i.e., it has Orcs, Trolls, etc.), and thus is subject to direct conflict with most Free Peoples. A covert company is not readily identifiable as an evil force, and thus can operate relatively freely in the domains of the Free Peoples.

### HEALING

Each of your characters at a Darkhaven may heal during the untap phase of your turn. Such a character moves from a wounded position to a tapped position. In addition, certain cards can heal characters when they are played (e.g., _Foul Smelling Paste_).

### RINGWRAITH EFFECTS

After being revealed, a Ringwraith operates like any other character except that it may only be in a company with other characters if it is at a Darkhaven. There are several other special effects:

 - Any gold ring in the Ringwraith's company is automatically tested at the beginning of the end-of-turn phase. Any ring test in a Ringwraith's company has a modification of -2.
 - A Ringwraith may carry items (including rings) but may not use them (i.e., an item has no effect on a Ringwraith's company or on his attributes and abilities).
 - Ringwraiths never make corruption decks and corruption cards may not be played on Ringwraiths.
 - The movement of Ringwraiths is restricted (see [page 25]()).

## 6 • MOVEMENT

In _MELE_ the lands of northwest Middle-earth are represented by regions. The site cards represent places that companies can visit within those regions. Except for a moving company during its movement/hazard phase, each company always has a _current site card_ associated with it—the company is located at that site.

{: .note }
> **Note:** Site paths do not direct the movement process. The site path is used to determine which hazard creatures your opponent may play against your moving company.
> 
> **Note:** By using the site cards and site cards only, a company can move from any site to any other site. First, if necessary, the company moves to the nearest Darkaven. Then, if necessary, it moves to other Darkhavens. Finally, it moves from that Haven to the destination site.

A company commits to moving by playing a _new site card_ (face down) during its organization phase. A company does not have to move during a given turn (i.e., it does not play a new site card).

At the beginning of its movement/hazard phase, a moving company's current site card becomes its _site of origin_—the company is considered to be en route to its new site card (i.e., the company is moving).

At the end of a moving company’s movement/hazard phase (before players return to their hand sizes), its site of origin is removed (discard if tapped; otherwise, return it to your location deck) and the new site card becomes the company’s current site card.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Some cards can interrupt this process by forcing a company to return to its site of origin.

{: .text-center }
![](/assets/images/mele-starter-movement.svg)
 
#### Moving From a Non-Darkhaven Site

If the company’s site of origin is a non-Darkhaven site, the new site card _must_ be the Darkhaven listed as the nearest Darkhaven on the site of origin card (i.e., the company can move back to its nearest Darkhaven).

#### Moving From a Darkhaven Site

If the company’s site of origin is a Darkhaven, the new site card must meet one of the following requirements:
 - If the new site card is not another Darkhaven, it must list the site of origin as its nearest Darkhaven (i.e., the company can move to any site that has the Darkhaven the company is at currently as the site's nearest Darkhaven).
 - If the new site card is another Darkhaven, it must give a site path to the Darkhaven (i.e., the company can move to one of its adjacent Darkhavens; each Darkhaven is adjacent to either one or two other Darkhavens).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If a company is not moving, no cards are drawn. If a company is moving to a non-Darkhaven site, you _may_ draw up to the # of cards indicated by the site that it is _moving to_ (at least one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same. If a company is moving to a Darkhaven site, you _may_ draw up to the # of cards indicated by the site that it is _moving from_ (at least one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same.
> 
> **Clarification:** To summarize the movement process:
> - Except for a moving company during its movement/hazard phase, each company is always at a specific site, called its _current site_.
> - A company wanting to move to a _new site_ plays a new site card face down beside its current site card by the end of its organization phase. A company can only move: from a non-darkhaven site to its “Nearest Haven,” from a Darkhaven site to one of its “adjacent Darkhavens,” or from a Darkhaven site to a non-Darkhaven site that lists that Darkhaven as its “Nearest Darkhaven.”
> - At the beginning of its movement/hazard phase, a moving company’s new site card is revealed and its current site card becomes its _site of origin_.
> - At the end of its movement/hazard phase, the site of origin is removed and the moving company’s new site card becomes the company’s current site card (unless the company is forced to return to its site of origin).
> 
> **Suggestion:** To help decide where a company should move, look at the resource cards in your hand. Then decide to which of your available sites to move. For example, if you have a major item, go to a site where a major item can be played.

{: .note }
> **Example:** Wendy’s company is at Barad-dur (i.e., its current site) and wants to go to The Lonely Mountain to try and bring the Smaug Aroused faction into play. Barad-dur’s nearest Darkhaven is Minas Morgul, while The Lonely Mountain's nearest Darkhaven is Dol Guldur. 
> 
> First, it takes one turn to move from Barad-dur to Minas Morgul using the site path, ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg), indicated on the Barad-dur site card. Wendy just plays the Minas Morgul site card as her new site card during her organization phase, and she removes the Barad-dur site card at the end of her company's movement/hazard phase.
> 
> During her next turn, the company may move from Minas Morgul to Dol Guldur using the site path, ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg), indicated on both the Minas Morgul and Dol Guldur site cards. Wendy plays the Dol Guldur site card during her organization phase, and she removes the Minas Morgul site card at the end of her company's movement/hazard phase. 
> 
> Finally, the company takes one turn to move from Dol Guldur to The Lonely Mountain using the site path, ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), indicated on The Lonely Mountain site card. Wendy plays The Lonely Mountain site card during her organization phase, and she removes the Dol Guldur site card at the end of her company's movement/hazard phase.

### MOVING YOUR RINGWRAITH'S COMPANY

The company containing your Ringwraith may freely move from Darkhaven to Darkhaven and from a non-Darkhaven site to a Darkhaven. However, in order to move from a Darkhaven to a non-Darkhaven site, a Ringwraith must have a special resource card: a _Black Rider_ card, a _Fell Rider_ card, or a _Heralded Lord_ card (i.e., the Ringwraith must be in Black Rider mode, in Fell Rider mode, or in Heralded Lord Mode).

{: .note }
> **Example:** Suppose Ren the Ringwraith is at Barad-dur and wants to move to The Lonely Mountain as outlined in the previous example. On his first turn, he moves to Minas Morgul—he does not need a special card because he is moving from a non-Darkhaven site to a Darkhaven. On his second turn, he moves from Minas Morgul to Dol Guldur as outlined—he does not need a special card because he is moving from a Darkhaven to a Darkhaven. On his third turn, he plays a _Black Rider_ card in order to move from Dol Guldur (a Darkhaven) to The Lonely Mountain (a non-Darkhaven).

### SITE PATHS

There are six types of regions and six types of sites:

| Region Type | Symbol |
| :--- | :--- | 
Coastal Seas | \[ ![](/assets/images/coastalsea.svg) ] |  
Free-domains |  \[ ![](/assets/images/free-domain.svg) ]  | 
Border-lands |  \[ ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ] | 
Wilderness  |  \[ ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ]  | 
Shadow-lands  | \[ ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ]  | 
Dark-domains  | \[ ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ]  |

| Site Type | Symbol |
| :--- | :--- | 
Darkhavens  |  \[ ![](/assets/images/dark-haven.svg) ]
Free-holds  | \[ ![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg) ]
Border-holds  | \[ ![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg) ]
Ruins & Lairs  | \[ ![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg) ]
Shadow-holds  | \[ ![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg) ]
Dark-holds |  \[ ![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg) ]

A _site path_ is the sequence of regions between a site and its nearest Darkhaven. However, each region in the sequence is only indicated by its type, not by its name. Each non-Darkhaven site card has a site path on it. Each Darkhaven site card has two site paths, but each of those two paths gives the sequence of regions between the Darkhaven and one of the two Darkhavens nearest to it.[^twopaths]

{: .note }
> **Note:** Site paths do not direct the movement process. The site path is used to determine which hazard creatures your opponent may play against your moving company (see [page 46]()).
> 
> **Clarification:** A “company’s site path” during its movement/hazard phase is the site path between its site of origin and its new site. On non-Darkhaven site cards, the site path is provided on the top left border. On Darkhaven cards, the site path to each of the two adjacent Darkhavens is provided in the card text.[^twopaths]

{: .note }
> **Example:** The Lonely Mountain site’s nearest Darkhaven is the Dol Guldur site. The symbol for Wilderness is ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), the symbol for Dark-domain is ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg). So the site path between Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain is: ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg). 
> 
> The regions between these two sites are Southern Mirkwood (Dark-domain), Heart of Mirkwood (Wilderness), and Northern Rhovanion (Wilderness).

{: .note }
> **Example:** In the Example of movement from Barad-dur to The Lonely Mountain on [page 25](), the first site path used was from Barad-dur to Minas Morgul: ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg). During that movement/hazard phase, Nick (Wendy’s opponent) can play hazard creatures keyed to Dark-domains (![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg)), Shadow-lands (![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg)), and Darkhavens (the new site). During the next turn, the company uses the site path from Minas Morgul to Dol Guldur: ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg). During that movement/hazard phase, Nick can play hazard creatures keyed to Shadow-lands (![](/assets/images/shadow-lands.svg)), double Shadow-lands (![](/assets/images/shadow-lands.svg) ![](/assets/images/shadow-lands.svg)), Dark-domains (![](/assets/images/dark-domains.svg)), double Dark-domains (![](/assets/images/dark-domains.svg) ![](/assets/images/dark-domains.svg)) and darkhavens (the new site). Finally, the company takes one turn to move from Dol Guldur to The Lonely Mountain using the site path, ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg). Nick can play hazard creatures keyed to Wilderness (![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg)), double Wilderness (![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg)), Shadow-lands (![](/assets/images/border-land.svg)), double Shadow-lands (![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg)), and Ruins & Lairs (the new site).

## 7 • COMBAT

Combat normally occurs when one of three things happen:

 - When a creature hazard is played on a company.
 - When a company at a site with an _automatic-attack_ decides to attempt to play a resource card for that site (i.e., decides to attempt to enter and explore the site).
 - When any other card indicates that a company must face an attack.

### ATTACKS & STRIKES

Combat consists of one or more _attacks_ that must be resolved one at a time. An attack consists of one or more _strikes_:

 - Each strike can target one and only one character in the attacked company.
 - Each character can be the target of only one strike from a given attack.
 - If an attack has more strikes than the company has characters, the attacker may allocate the excess strikes as -1 modifiers (i.e., a -1 modifier for each unallocated strike) to the prowess(es) of whichever target(s) he chooses. See the Strike Sequence on [page 33]().
 - You and your opponent must play any cards that modify the number of strikes before you assign the strikes. 

Unless the attack states otherwise, the defender chooses which _untapped_ characters will be the targets of given strikes. Then, the attacker chooses which other defending characters not yet assigned a strike will be the target of any remaining unassigned strikes. 

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If the text on a creature card states that the “attacker chooses defending characters,” any characters (not yet assigned a strike) in the defending company may be chosen (by the attacker) as the targets of the attack’s strikes.
> 
> **Clarification:** The defender may choose not to assign strikes that he is allowed to assign. These strikes are then assigned by the attacker to any characters that have not yet been assigned strikes.
> 
> **Clarification:** All of an attack’s strikes must be assigned to the characters in the defending company or as modifiers to the strikes assigned. The attacker may **not** choose to not apply strikes or excess strike modifiers. Only those strikes that are assigned need be defeated for the creature’s marshalling points to be received by the defender.

#### Strike Modifications

There are a number of standard modifications to the prowess of each target character facing a strike:

 - Each unwounded, tapped character must modify his prowess by -1.
 - Each wounded character must modify his prowess by -2.
 - Normally a character that is the target of a strike is tapped after the strike is resolved. However, a character that is the target of a strike may choose to take a -3 modification to his prowess to avoid being tapped. If so, the character is not tapped after the strike is resolved (he may still be wounded).
 - If an attack has more strikes than the company has characters, the attacker may allocate the excess strikes as -1 modifiers to the prowesses of whichever target(s) he chooses. See the Strike Sequence on [page 33]().
 - The target’s prowess may also be modified due to the play of certain resource and hazard cards. Only one resource card requiring skill may be played against a given strike.

| Condition | Mod. to Target's Prowess |
| :--- | ---: |
 Tapped character * | -1
 Wounded character * | -2
 Untapped character decides not to tap * | -3
 For each unused strike allocated (i.e., each extra strike) * | -1
 Up to one resource card that requires skill | varies
 Other resource cards | varies
 Hazard cards | varies
 
 {: .note }
 > **Clarification:** The prowess modifications marked with an * above are applied for a given strike and then are removed immediately after the attack is resolved. That is they do not carry over from strike to strike.
 > 
 > **Note:** Ignore effects that modify the number of strikes for an attack that states that "every character in the target company faces one strike" (unless an effect reduces the number of strikes to a specific number, e.g., _Veils of Shadow_).
 
#### Resolving Strikes

Strikes are resolved one at a time as decided by the defending player. When you choose a strike to resolve, determine all of the factors affecting the strike before the roll is made (see “The Strike Sequence” below). To resolve a strike, the defender makes a roll (2D6) and adds his modified prowess:

 - If this result is greater than the strike’s prowess, the strike _fails_. Such a strike is defeated if its body attribute is “–” **or** if it has a body attribute and fails a body check.
 - If this result is equal to the strike’s prowess, the strike was _ineffectual_ (i.e., the strike is avoided but not defeated).
 - Otherwise, the strike was _successful_ (i.e., the character was defeated). If the attack was a "detainment" attack, an untapped target is tapped. Otherwise, the target character is wounded and must make a body check.

#### Body Checks

If a strike against a character is successful and the attack was _not_ a detainment attack, the character is wounded and must make a body check. To make a body check, the **attacker** makes a roll (2D6). If the character was already wounded before this strike, the roll is modified by +1.

 - The text on certain characters' cards states: "Discard on a body check result of # or #." In this case, you must discard the character if the modified body check roll is equal to either of these numbers.
 - Otherwise, if the modified body check roll is greater than the character's body attribute, the character is eliminated.
 - Otherwise, nothing further happens (i.e., the character is just wounded).

{: .note }
> **Note:** As a result of certain rolls, certain characters may be discarded rather than being wounded. These characters are usually Orcs and Trolls. This effect represents the target running or slinking away from the attack.
> 
> **Clarification:** If a character was already wounded before a strike wounds him again, the resulting body check modification is always +1 (regardless of how many times a character is wounded).
> 
> **Clarification:** If a strike against a character is successful, a body check must be resolved for the character before anything else happens. For example, _Foul Smelling Paste_ may not be used to heal such a character until after the body check is resolved (of course, if the character is eliminated, the _Foul Smelling Paste_ may not be used on him at all).

As presented above, a strike that fails is defeated if its body attribute is “–” **or** if it has a body attribute and fails a body check. To make such a body check, the **defender** makes a roll (2D6); if this value is greater than the strike’s _body attribute_, the strike is defeated.

{: .note } 
> **Example:** _Landroval_ has a prowess of 12 and a body of 6. He normally has two strikes when he attacks. If one of his strikes against a character fails, the defender makes a body check. If the resulting roll is greater than 6, that strike is defeated. However, both of _Landroval
> s_ strikes must be defeated in order for him to be eliminated—this would require at least two body check rolls greater than 6.

#### "Detainment" Attacks

Certain attacks detain targets rather than wound them. When a strike from a detainment attack is successful, an untapped target is tapped instead of being wounded. This represents the target being stopped and questioned. The following types of attacks are detainment attacks:

 - Card text will sometimes state that an attack is a detainment attack.
 - Any Nazgul attack against a minion company is a detainment attack.
 - Any attack keyed to Dark-domain, Shadow-hold, or Dark-hold is a detainment attack.
 - Any Orc, Troll, Undead, or Man attack keyed to Shadow-land is a detainment attack.
 
The parameters above apply if the attack is keyed to the region symbol or site symbol (by type) **or** if keyed to a region or site by name which happens to be of the appropriate type (i.e. has the appropriate symbol).

### Defeating an Attack

An attack by a hazard creature is defeated if it is _not_ a detainment attack **and** all of its strikes directed against (i.e., assigned to) a company are defeated. 

If even one of the strikes was canceled or ineffectual, the attack is **not** defeated. If the attack is canceled, the attack is **not** defeated. A canceled attack has no effect on the defending company (though the company is considered in its history to have faced it). A detainment attack from a creature is never defeated and the creature's card is always discarded after the attack is resolved. 

If a hazard creature has multiple attacks, each **must** be defeated in order for the creature to be defeated.

{: .note }
> **Example:** Lagduf is untapped with a prowess of 5 and a body of 8. He is facing a strike from a _Huorn_ (only has one strike) with a prowess of 10 and a body of “–.” Lagduf could decide not to tap against the strike; in which case his prowess would only be 2 (his normal prowess of 5, minus 3 for not tapping) against this strike. However, Lagduf decides to tap to face the strike.
> 
> Lagduf rolls an 8. 8 plus his prowess of 5 is greater than the Huorn’s prowess of 10. Therefore, the strike fails and the _Huorn_ attack is defeated (it only has one strike and its body attribute is “–”). 
> 
> Next Lagduf has to face a _Slayer_, which has two attacks against the same character, each with one strike at 11 prowess. Lagduf is tapped, so he now has a -1 to his prowess (i.e., his prowess is 4).
> 
> Against the first attack's strike Lagduf rolls a 7. His total is 11 (= 7 + 4) which ties the strike's prowess of 11. Therefore the strike is ineffectual and nothing happens.
> 
> Against the next attack, Lagduf rolls a 3. His total of 7 (= 3 + 4) is less than the strike's prowess of 11. Therefore the strike is successful. Lagduf is immediately wounded and must make a body check. His opponent rolls the dice for the body check. If he rolls a 9 or more, Lagduf will be eliminated
and removed from play. Lagduf's opponent actually rolls an 8 and Lagduf is not eliminated. However, Lagduf is discarded because his card states that he is discarded on a body check result of 8. 

#### Marshalling Points

You receive creature marshalling points for defeating a creature with an * next to its marshalling points. Place the card in your marshalling point pile.

If you defeat a creature that does _not_ have an * next to its marshalling points, place the card in your out-of-play pile. You do **not** not receive marshalling points for eliminating it.

{: .note }
> **Note:** A Wizard player does not receive marshalling points for defeating a creature with an * next to its marshalling points.

### THE STRIKE SEQUENCE

The “strike sequence” is the time from when a player declares that one of his characters will resolve a strike until the strike die roll is made and any associated body checks are made.

Strikes are resolved one at a time as decided by the defending player (i.e., he chooses a strike to resolve, the strike is resolved, he chooses the next strike to resolve, the strike is resolved, etc.).

All of the factors affecting the strike must be decided during the strike sequence before making the roll (2D6). Cards that do not affect the strike may not be played during the strike sequence. Address these factors in the following order:

 1. The attacker may play hazard cards that affect the strike (these count toward the hazard limit against this company).
 2. The attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining (if any) -1 modifiers due to unallocated strikes (i.e., strikes in excess of the company’s size).
 3. A target untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not automatically tap following the strike sequence.
 4. The defending player may play resource cards that affect the strike (up to one card that requires skill).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The prowess modifier and maximum for a weapon is applied to a character before any other modifications. For example, the Lieutenant of Dol Guldur has a base prowess of 7 and a _Broad-headed Spear_ (+2 prowess to a maximum of 8)—he starts with a prowess of 8 before any other modifiers are applied.
> 
> Similarly, the body modification and maximum for a shield, armor, or helmet is applied before any other modifications.

{: .note }
> **Example of Combat** _\[(#/#) means (prowess/body)]_
> 
> You control Broin (3/8), Threlin (4/7) and his follower Dogrib (4/7) with _Foul-smelling Paste_, Jerrel (5/8), and Nevido Smod (4/8) (with a _Shadow-cloak_). They are en route from Carn Dum to Geann a-Lisch. There are 5 characters in the company, meaning the hazard limit is 5. 
> 
> Your opponent plays _Orc-raiders_. He keys this hazard creature to one of the Wilderness in your company’s site path. Broin, a scout, taps and plays _A Nice Place to Hide_ to cancel the attack. _Orc-raiders_ is discarded. 
> 
> Your opponent next plays _Orc-warband_ (second hazard). He states it is keyed to a Wilderness in your company's site path, becasue the _Orc-warband_ becomes a detainment attack if he keys it to a Shadow-land. It’s a (4/-) hazard creature with 5 strikes that receives +3 to prowess against a company that has faced an Orc attack. Even though Broin canceled the _Orc-raiders_, the company is still considered to have faced them, so the _Orc-warband_ will be (7/-). There are 5 strikes and 5 characters, so each character will face one strike (no decisions on strike allocation can be made). Broin elects to face his strike first. His opponent plays _Weariness of the Heart_ (third hazard) on Broin to give -1 to his prowess. This modification to his prowess is in addition to the -1 Broin suffers for being tapped. No other effects are played to affect the strike and Broin rolls the dice. The result is a 4. Broin’s prowess of 1 plus the dice roll is less than the prowess of the _Orc-warband’s_ strike against Broin, so Broin is wounded. Your opponent rolls the body check. It’s a 7—Broin lives! 
> 
> Nevido Smod faces the next strike. Nevido Smod taps and rolls a 2, falling to a successfil strike. Your opponent rolls a body check, but only gets a 4 so Nevido Smod lives. Dogrib chooses to face his strike next. He chooses not to tap and therefore gets a -3 modifications to his prowess. He rolls a 6 which ties the prowess of the _Orc-warband_ strike. The strike is ineffectual. Threlin resolves his strike next, taps, and defeats it by rolling a 7. Jerrek resolves the final strike, taps, and defeats it by rolling a 3. _Orc-warband_ is discarded. 
> 
> Your opponent sees that one character, Dogrib, is untapped. He plays an _Elf-lord Revealed in Wrath_ (15/9) (a fourth hazard) keyed to the Shadow-land (_Doors of Night_ is not in play) and reasons that Dogrib will have to take its one very powerful strike with little chance of cancelling it. (After all, if you give up the option of assigning the one strike to your untapped character, namely Dogrib, the opponent will be able to choose, from all 5 characters, which will take the strike). Your opponent does not see what Dogrib sees. Before assigning the strike, Dogrib discards his _Foul-smelling Paste_ to heal and untap Nevido Smod, who then announces he is taking the strike. The _Elf-lord_ is keyed to the Shadow-land, so Nevido Smod taps his _Shadow-cloak_ to cancel its single strike. The _Elf-lord_ is discarded.
> 
> The opponent announces he will play no more hazards and the company breathes a sigh of relief. Broin will be able to heal at the start of the next turn since his company will be at Grann a-Lisch, a Haven.

## 8 • CORRUPTION

As Sauron's minions (i.e., your characters) operate in Middle-earth, they are subject to temptations. A character runs the risk of becoming totally corrupted and fleeing Sauron's "service" to pursue his own nefarious schemes (i.e., a corrupted character leaves play).

Each character has a corruption point total. This starts at zero, but certain cards and activities will change this total during play. Most cards that affect a character’s corruption are kept under the character’s card until they are discarded. Only one corruption card (a hazard card that gives corruption points) may be played on a given character each turn.

{: .note }
> **Note:** Minion characters are not completely subjected to Sauron will. If they were, they would be of little use—independent, but loyaL servants can accomplish much more than slaves. So, minion characters can be corrupted by having their own individual desires and temptations conflict with the goals of their masters. A corrupted minion character has decided that it is in his own best interest to make himself scarce and head for parts unknown. Ringwraiths can not be corrnpted—they already suffered the ultimate corruption when they became Ringwraiths.

### CORRUPTION CARDS

For these purposes, a “corruption card” is a _hazard card_ that gives a character corruption points. A corruption card's text includes the word "_Corruption._" in italics. Cards that force a corruption check but do not give corruption points (e.g., _Weariness of the Heart_) are not “corruption cards.” A corruption card is limited as follows. 

 - A character may have more than one corruption card, but only one may be played on him each turn.
 - Certain corruption cards state: "Cannot be duplicated on a given character." So, a given character may only have one of each such corruption card.
 - Corruption cards that may not be played on Dwarves may also not be played on Orcs.
 - Corruption cards may not be played on Ringwraiths.

### CORRUPTION POINTS

A character’s corruption point total can be determined at any time by summing the corruption point values of: the corruption cards under his card **and** any other cards he controls (e.g., usually items).

### CORRUPTION CHECKS

When a card or other effect indicates that one of your characters must make a corruption check, you must make a roll (2D6) and add any appropriate modifications. One of the following results:

**Nothing Happens** — If the modified result is greater than the character’s corruption point total, nothing happens. 

**The Character Taps** — If the modified result is equal to the character’s corruption point total **or** one less than the character’s corruption point total, the is very tempted but does _not_ fail the corruption check. If the character is untapped, tap the character.

**The Character is Eliminated** — If the modified result is less than character’s corruption point total by two or more, the character _fails_ the corruption check and is eliminated (i.e., remove him from play) and you must discard any non-follower cards he controls.

Ringwraiths never make corruption checks.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A character eliminated due to a corruption check is removed from active play. He may not be played again by either you or by your opponent. In this case, the character is permanently lost to Sauron.

### CORRUPTION CHECK MODIFIERS

Certain characters receive modifiers to corruption checks, and certain cards may give modifiers to a corruption check. Modifiers to corruption checks are printed in the lower right of the appropriate card. A plus or a minus sign indicates a **modifier** to any corruption checks a character makes (rather than corruption points).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** There are two different values that affect corruption checks:
>  - _Corruption check modifications_ always have either a plus (+) sign or a minus (–) sign (e.g., as noted on many character cards). The sum of all such applicable modifications are added to the corruption check roll.
>  - _Corruption point values_ never have a plus or minus sign. The sum of all such values is the character’s corruption point total for the purposes of a corruption check. 
>  
>  Both values appear in the lower right of certain cards.

### REMOVING CORRUPTION CARDS

A character may choose to ignore the restriction that he tap to remove a corruption card (as printed on a corruption card), and suffer a -3 penalty to the dice roll to remove it. This means a character can remain untapped and still attempt to remove a corruption card (the roll is modified by -3), or that he can attempt to remove a corruption card even if he is already tapped or wounded (the roll is modified by -3).

Each turn. a character may only make one removal attempt for each corruption card if he uses the -3 modifier.

{: .note }
> **Example:** At the beginning of his organization phase, Tarcil has three corruption cards: _Lure of Nature_, _Lure of Expedience_, and _Lure of the Senses_. He taps and rolls to attempt to remove the _Lure of the Senses_; his roll is an 8, so the card is removed (greater than 6 was required). If instead, Tarcil had not tapped to attempt to remove _Lure of the Senses_, he would have failed (he would have needed to roll greater than a 9).
> 
> He then rolls to attempt to remove _Lure of Nature_; his roll is a 6 modified by -3 for a net result of 3, so the card is not removed (greater than 4 was required). Finally, he rolls to attempt to remove _Lure of Expedience_; his roll is a 9 modified by -3 for a net result of 6. This is greater than the 5 that is required, so the card is removed.

{: .note }
> **Example:** (CP = Corruption Point) Let us look at Layos traveling across Middle-earth. He starts out carrying a _Blazon of the Eye_, so he only has 1 CP when he leaves Carn Dum. For this example assume Layos is traveling with other Men who take care of any attacks played on his company.
> 
> First he heads to the Dunnish Clan-hold. On the way there he gets a _Lure of Expedience_ played on him, which gives him 2 more CPs for a total of 3. While at the Dunnish Clan-hold he taps to plays _High Helm_. Not only does this raise his CP total to 5, but it also triggers a corruption check from the _Lure of Expedience_. Layos rolls a 6, which is greater than his CP total of 5, so he is fine.
> 
> During the organization phase Layos attempts to remove the _Lure of Expedience_. Since he is planning to return to Cam Dum, he is not worried about being tapped. So, he taps and rolls an 8, easily better than the 5 he needed to succeed. His CP total drops to 3.
> 
> On the way back to Carn Dum, Layos gets a _Lure of Nature_ played on him, bringing him back up to 5 CPs. Since there are three Wildernesses in the site path between Dunnish Clan-hold and Carn Dum, Layos must make three corruption checks. On the first two he rolls a 7 and a 12, easily beating his corruption point total. On the third check he rolls a 4. Since this is one less than his CP total, he would normally tap. However, he is already tapped, so there is no effect.
> 
> At Cam Dum he tries to remove the _Lure of Nature_ without tapping. He rolls a 7 modified by -3 for not tapping—this is not greater than 4, so the _Lure of Nature_ is not removed. Layos would like to tap and try again; but, since he tried without tapping, he cannot make another attempt.
> 
> His company moves to Dol Guldur. The hazard player plays a _Lure of the Senses_ on Layos bringing his CP total up to 7.
> 
> At the beginning of his next turn, Layos is ready to tap to attempt to remove the _Lure of the Senses_, and then the _Lure of Narure_ without tapping. Unfortunately, he first has to make a corruption check at the end of the Untap phase because of his _Lure of the Senses_. He rolls a 5. Since this is 2 Jess than his CP total, he is eliminated from the game and his _Blazon of the
Eye_ and _High Helm_ are discarded.

## 9 • INFLUENCE

You have a pool of general influence. Your characters have direct influence. These two forms of influence can control and affect characters (see [pages 18-20]()) and factions.

Your _unused general influence_ is equal to 20 minus the sum of the mind attributes of your non-follower characters in play (i.e., do not count your followers).

A character’s _unused direct influence_ is equal to his direct influence attribute minus the sum of the mind attributes of his followers. All characters have a direct influence attribute of at least zero, so any character has unused direct influence of at least zero.

{: .note}
> **Note:** In the Standard Game, direct influence can be used to attempt to interfere with your opponent’s control of his characters, followers, factions, allies, and items (see [page 64]()).

### BRINGING A FACTION INTO PLAY

In order to play a faction card, you must tap one of your characters that is at the “site” indicated on the faction’s card. Then you must make an influence check. Make a roll (2D6), add your character’s unused direct influence, and add any appropriate modifications (any applicable _standard modifications_ from the faction card and from any other cards played). All influence check modifier cards must be played before making the roll (2D6).

If the modified result is greater than the value required on the faction card, you place the faction in your marshalling point pile ![](/assets/images/scroll.svg)[^factionmppile] (it now counts towards your marshalling point total). Otherwise, you discard the faction card. Once a faction is brought into play, it is not controlled by any specific character and it does not count against general or direct influence.
 
### STANDARD MODIFICATIONS

Most faction cards list some “standard modifications” to the influence check based only upon what other factions are already in play for both players. 

{: .note }
> **Note:** Some standard modifications are given for factions not included in _MELE_. Later products will include these factions.
> 
> **Clarification:** Certain characters have special modifications to influence checks. Such a modification only applies if it belongs to the character that was tapped to make the influence check.

{: .note }
> **Example:** During your site phase, you have Lieutenant of Morgul in play in a company at Lossadan Cairn. You also have _Ice-Orcs_ in your hand, and your opponent has Wargs of Forochel in play. Lieutenant of Morgul has no followers, so his unused direct influence is 2.
> 
> You tap Lieutenant of Morgul to attempt to bring the _Ice-orcs_ into play. You make your influence check roll (2D6), and the result is 5. This roll is modified by:
> - Lieutenant of Morgul's unused direct influence: +2
> - +3 — Lieutenant of Morgul has a special ability: his direct influence is increased by +3 against Orc factions.
> - A standard modification of +2 because the _Wargs of Forochel_ are already in play, as listed on the _Ice-Orcs_ card.
> 
> So the modified result is 11 (= 5+2+3+1). Since this is greater than 10 (the number required by the faction card), the _Ice-Orcs_ are successfully brought into play and the site taps.
> 
> If you had rolled a 3, your modified result would have been 9 (= 3+2+3+1), and you would have had to discard the faction and Lossadan Cairn would not have tapped.

## 10 • PLAYING AND DRAWING CARDS

You may only play hazard cards during your opponent’s movement/hazard phase. Except for resource long-events, you may play resource cards anytime during your own turn unless specifically prohibited by the rules or the cards themselves.

Unless stated otherwise, a card is playable only if its effect applies to an existing situation, hazard, attack, etc. (i.e., you may not play a card just to discard it).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** An automatic-attack at a company’s new site may be targeted by a hazard during the company’s movement/hazard phase. Such a hazard may be played even if the attack will not be faced (i.e., if the company decides not to face the automatic-attack during the site phase).
> a
> **Note:** _MELE_ resources are different from _METW_ resources. _MELE_ resources are referred to as "minion resources" and _METW_ resources are referred to as "hero resources." See [page 74]() for more information.
 
During your movement/hazard phase, both players draw cards when each company moves. If a company moves to a non-Darkhaven site, you _may_ draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that it _moved to_ (at least one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same. If the company moves to a Darkhaven site, you _may_ draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that you _moved from_ (at least one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same.

### EVENTS

There are both resource events and hazard events. Each event falls into one of three classifications based upon how long it stays in play.

**Short-event** — A short-event’s effects are immediately implemented; then, it is discarded. The effects of some short-events last for a specific period as stated on its card (e.g., some say: “until the end of the turn”).

**Permanent-event** — The effects of a resource permanent-event are immediately implemented. Its effects last until the card is discarded. Certain effects can cause a permanent-event to be discarded; these effects are given in the text of specific cards.<br>If one of your companies splits into 2 or more companies, you may place any resource permanent-events that were on the original company (as a whole) with any of the resulting companies.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Hazard short-events and permanent-events can be played only during an opponent’s movement/hazard phase. Resource short-events and permanent-events can be played at any time during your turn—as limited by specific card text.

**Long-event** — The effects of a long-event are immediately implemented when it is played. Long-events last approximately two turns, one of yours and one of your opponent’s.

You may only play a resource long-event during your long-event phase. Its card and effects remain in play until your next long-event phase or until otherwise discarded.

You may only play a hazard long-event during your opponent’s movement/hazard phase. Its card and effects remain in play until your opponent’s next long-event phase or until otherwise discarded.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The effects of many long-events and permanent-events affect both players because they can remain in effect during both players’ turns. Remember, when you play a long-event hazard, it will remain in effect during your next turn. For example, _Awaken Denizens_ increases the # of automatic-attack strikes at Ruins & Lairs for one turn for each player.

{: .note }
> **Example:** One of Nicks’s companies with a hazard limit of six is moving from Minas Morgul to Dunharrow; its site path is ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/free-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg). Wendy plays _Doors of Night_ (a permanent-event) during Nicks’s movement/hazard phase. This causes all resource environment cards in play to be discarded and their effects are canceled. This card will remain in play until it is discarded due to the play of _Skies of Fire_, _Twilight_, or another card that says it forces the discard of _Doors of Night_ or a hazard permanent-event.
> 
> Wendy then plays _Fell Winter_ (a long-event). First it gives all Border-holds \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)] (including Dunharrow) an automatic-attack: Wolves — 3 strikes at 7 prowess. Since _Doors of Night_ is in play it can do two more things: change all Border-lands \[![](/assets/images/border-land.svg)] into Wilderness \[![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg)], making the site path ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/free-domain.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg); and change all Free-domains \[![](/assets/images/free-domain.svg)] into Border-lands \[![](/assets/images/border-land.svg)], making the site path ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg). Unless it is discarded by another card, _Fell Winter_ will stay in play until Wendy's next long-event phase (about two turns).
> 
> Finally, Wendy plays _Arouse Defenders_ (a short-event), which allows her to add 3 to the prowess of one automatic-auack at a Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)]. She uses it on Dunharrow and chooses to add 3 to the Wolf attack from _Fell Winter_, making the prowess 10. _Arouse Defenders_ is discarded, but its effect will remain until the end of the turn (unless canceled before then).

### RESOURCE CARDS, NON-EVENT

Certain resource cards may only be played if specific required conditions exist. A faction card, ally card, or item card must be played during your site phase and requires an untapped character and an untapped site. In addition, the company must face any automatic-attacks located at the same site before such a card can be played. Resource events do not generally require an untapped site nor that the automatic-attack to be faced. This may vary based upon specific card text.

Normally, when a character leaves play, all cards controlled or on him are discarded. There are two major exceptions to this:

 - Sometimes, the card that causes the character to leave play allows him to transfer an item(s) (e.g., _Call of Home_).
 - If a character is eliminated due to failing a body check, one item can be immediately transferred to each unwounded character in his company; but, the rest of his items are discarded.

#### Factions

If one of your characters is at the site specified on a faction card, he may tap to attempt an influence check in order to play the faction card. If the character successfully influences the faction as indicated on the faction’s card (see [pages 38-39]()), the faction card is placed in your play area. After a faction is successfully played at a site, the site card is tapped.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If an attack from a Dragon faction is defeated, remove the Dragon from play. No player receives its marshalling points.
> 
> **Clarification:** Once a faction is brought into play, it is not associated with any character or company. A faction plays no active role after it is brought into play. 
 
#### Allies

A character may tap during the site phase to play an ally card if he is at the site specified on the ally card **and** the character meets the requirements indicated on the ally card. The ally card is placed under the character’s card and that character controls the ally. After an ally is played at a site, the site card is tapped. An ally does **not** count as a character for any purposes other than combat and the use of certain skills. Allies can **not** bear items.

An ally with a skill may take actions and play cards that require that skill. For example, _Last Child of Ungoliant_ has the sage skill, so she can tap to play a _Secerts of Their Forging_ card. Similarly, _Stinker_ has the scout skill so he can tap to play a _Sneakin'_ card. 

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Allies that are eliminated are placed in the out-of-play pile (i.e., neither player may bring that ally back into play). Allies are not affected by corruption.

#### Items

If a character is at an untapped site that indicates that a specific type of item card (gold ring, minor, major, or greater) is “playable,” he may tap during the site phase to bring an item of that type into play. The item card is placed under the character’s card. After an item is played at a site, the site card is tapped.

A special item states as what sites and under which conditions it is "playable."

A character may only use the effects of one _weapon_ at a time **and** one _shield_ at a time **and** one _armor_ at a time.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A special item with the keyword, Ring, at the beginning of its text does not tap the character or the site when played.
> 
> **Clarification:** An item only taps when used if its text states so. Thus, weapons and armor do not normally tap when used.
> 
> **Clarification:** A character may control (i.e., bear) any item, even if he cannot use its abilities.
> 
> **Clarification:** A character may control (i.e., bear) more than one weapon or more than one shield or more than one armor. However, only one of each type may be used at any given time.

#### Minor Items

If a resource card that taps a site (e.g., ally, faction, item, etc.) is successfully played at a site, one additional character may tap to play a minor item. Such a minor item may be played even if the site does not specifically state that a minor item is playable at the site. For example, a minor item played when bringing an ally into play would simulate a gift from the ally.

#### Rings

One of the types of items that your characters can bring into play are rings. There are 7 types of rings: mind rings, gold rings, lesser rings, magic rings, Dwarven rings, spirit rings, and _The One Ring_.

**Gold Rings** — After your company faces the automatic-attack at such a site which specifies that a gold ring can be played, you just tap a character and the site to play a gold ring from your hand.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A gold ring is a ring with unknown properties—it might be a lesser ring, a magic ring, a Dwarven ring, or even _The One Ring_. You will not know until you "test" it. There are 6 different gold rings in _MELE_: _A Little Gold Ring_, _The Least of Gold Rings_, _Gold Ring that Sauron Fancies_, _Bright Gold Ring_, _Gleaming Gold Ring_, and _Perfect Gold Ring_. Each has a different probability of being a specific type of special ring.

**Testing a Gold Ring** — Once you have a gold ring, you can "test" it to determine what kind of special ring it is. When you test a gold ring, you make a roll and add any applicable modification (due to the test card used and other cards). The gold ring card will indicate what special rings may be played based upon the modified roll.<br>If the roll indicates a special ring that you have in your hand, you may replace the gold ring with that ring and discard the gold ring. Otherwise, you just discard the gold ring (i.e., it was not that special). If the roll indicates more than one special ring in your hand,
you choose which to play.

There are five ways to test a gold ring:
 - If you have a sage character in the same company as the gold ring, you can play a _Test of Fire_ card.
 - If you have a sage character in the same company as the gold ring and the company is at a site where "Information" is playable, you can play a _Secret of Their Forging_ card (you do not have to roll, you can just play any special item ring except _The One Ring_).
 - Any gold ring in the Ringwraith's own company at the start of the end-of-turn phase is automatically tested. Any ring test in a Ringwraith's own company has a modification of -2.
 - Any gold ring in one of your companies at Barad-dur at the start of the end-of-turn phase is automatically tested. Any ring test at Barad-dur has a -3 modification.
 - If you store a gold ring, it is automatically tested with a modification of -2

{: .note }
> **Note:** Due to the -2 and -3 modifications, the last three ring test methods given above have little chance of resulting in _The One Ring_. This reflects the influence of "fate" on Sauron's efforts to find _The One Ring_.

{: .note }
> **Example:** You have Tarci! and Pon Opar (a sage) in the same company. Tarcil has _A little Gold Ring_. In your hand, you have a _Test of Fire_ card and three ring cards: _Trifling Ring_ (a lesser ring), _Magic Ring of Lies_, and _Dwarven Ring of Durin's Tribe_.
> 
> Because Pon Opar is a sage in the same company as a gold ring, you play your _Test of Fire_ on Tarcil's gold ring at any time during your turn. You roll a 5 for the test, so you may play either your _Trifling Ring_ (any result) or your _Magic Ring of Lies_ (6 or less) with Tarcil. In either case, the gold ring is discarded. If you had rolled a 9 or higher, you would have had the choice of playing your _Dwarven Ring of Durin's Tribe_ or your _Trifling Ring_.

{: .note }
> **Note:** A Ringwraith may carry a ring but may not use it (i.e., all items have no effect on a Ringwraith's company or on his attributes and abilities).
> 
> **Clarification:** Mind rings are minor items and are played as such. They are **not** special items.

### THE HAZARD LIMIT

During your opponent’s movement/hazard phase, the number of hazard cards that you may play on one of your opponent’s companies is that company’s _hazard limit_. The hazard limit is equal to two **or** the company’s size, whichever is greater. A company’s size is equal to the number of characters in it. For this purpose allies do **not** count as characters.

A hazard limit can be modified by the play of certain cards. Tapping a Nazgul permanent-event _does_ count against the hazard limit. 

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** For the purposes of calculating hazard limits, each company’s size is determined for each company at the beginning of the movement/hazard phase (i.e., it remains fixed). So, if a character is eliminated during his company’s portion of the movement/hazard phase, his company’s hazard limit does not change.

### HAZARD CARDS, NON-EVENT

Hazard cards represent evil forces and natural dangers in Middle-earth. Even though your Ringwraith and his minions are serving Sauron, the evil forces in the world will often attack you on purpose or by mistake—that's the nature of evil.

You may play hazard cards only during your opponent’s movement/hazard phase. Detainment attacks are described on [page 31]().

{: .note }
> Hazards that give bonuses to attacks do **not** give bonuses to characters and companies.

### Creature Cards

You may use a creature card to _directly attack_ one of your opponent’s companies. Such an attack can occur only if one of the following criterion is met:

- The company is at a specific site at which the creature’s card text says it can be played.
- The company’s site of origin or new site is in a region where the creature’s card text says it can be played.
- One of the site symbols on the creature’s card matches the site that the company moved to (i.e., the new site) or stayed at (i.e., if the company did not move).
- At least one of the region symbols on the creature’s card matches one of the region types the company moved through this turn (see below). If the creature’s card has two region symbols of the same type (i.e., a deep Wilderness creature), then the company must have moved through at least two regions of that same type.

{: .note }
> **Note:** The Geann a-Lisch site is a Darkhaven. However, as stated on its card, creatures keyed to Ruins & Lairs may be played against a company that has Geann a-Lisch as its new site or as its current site if it did not move.
> 
> **Clarification:** Two wilderness symbols are required in a site path to play a deep Wilderness creature. However, the two symbols need not be adjacent in the site path. For example, a deep wilderness creature may be played keyed to the site path: ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg) ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg). If a company travels with two Wilderness in its site path, the chance of encountering very dangerous Wilderness monsters has doubled, even if the two wildernesses are not adjacent.

If a creature satisfies more than one of these conditions, you must choose (when you play the creature) one of these conditions that the attack is “keyed to.” The effects of certain cards are based upon the region or site type that a creature is _keyed to_.

The region types that a company moves through during a given turn are determined by the following criteria:

 - If a company did not play a new site card, it did not move through any regions—so, no creature may be played based solely on region conditions.
 - If the company was at a _Darkhaven_ and has played a new _non-Darkhaven_ site card, the region types are indicated by the new site card’s site path.
 - If the company was at a _Darkhaven_ site and has played a new _Darkhaven_ site card (but no region cards), the region types are indicated by the new Darkhaven site card’s “Site Path from” the old Darkhaven site (i.e., the site path from the site of origin Darkhaven).
 - If the company was at a _non-Darkhaven_ site and has played a new _Darkhaven_ site card (but no region cards), the region types are indicated by the site of origin’s site path (i.e., the site path on the site that the company left).
 - _Standard Rules:_ If the company used region movement, the region types of the site path are indicated by the region cards or an appropriate map (i.e., each region card has a region type).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The player that plays a hazard creature must specifically state the type of region or site that a creature is keyed to—it can affect the use of other cards.<br>For example, if a character with a _Shadow-cloak_ faces a strike from a creature that has been played keyed to a Shadow-land, he can tap the _Shadow-cloak_ to cancel the strike. However, if the creature is keyed to a Border-land, he cannot use his cloak against it.
> 
> **Note:** A creature played keyed to a specific region by name is **not** keyed to the specific region's type. For example, if _Thranduil's Folk_ is played keyed to the Grey Mountain Narrows (a Shadow-land region), a target character with a _Shadow-cloak_ can **not** use it to cancel a strike—the attack is keyed to the region by name, not by type.

{: .note }
> **Example:** Certain card combinations make creatures more powerful. The hazard creature, _Dire Wolves_, has 4 strike with a prowess of 8. However, if played in combination with a _Wake of War_ card, _Dire Wolves_ has 5 strikes with a prowess of 9. If played in combination with a _Wake of War_ and a
_Doors of Night_, _Dire Wolves_ has 6 strikes with a prowess of 10.

### STORING CARDS

During your organization phase, you may _store_ any of your items that are at a Darkhaven site. The controlling character must make a corruption check before an item can be stored.

A stored item is placed in your _marshalling point pile_ and counts for marshalling points. Once an item is stored it may not be unstored and brought back into play. _The One Ring_ may never be stored.

Some items and resource cards state that they can be stored when at a specific site (e.g., the _Seize Prisoners_ card can be stored at a Darkhaven)—other cards may not be stored. Such an item or resource card is still placed in the marshalling point pile and cannot be brought back into play.

{: .note }
> **Note:** If you store a gold ring, it is automatically tested (see [page 44]()).
> 
> **Clarification:** A character bearing a certain type of card cannot untap until the card is stored (as stated in the card's text). After storing such a card, the character does not untap until the untap phase of his player’s next turn. 
> 
> **Clarification:** Unless stated otherwise on the card, the marshalling points for a card that can be stored apply regardless of whether or not the card is stored.

### TRANSFERRING ITEMS

During your organization phase, you may transfer items between characters at the same site. The controlling character must make a corruption check before an item can be transferred.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A corruption check is required before an item can be stored or transferred. A character that fails such a corruption check has decided not to follow his Ringwraith’s commands concerning the item’s use (i.e., the item is discarded and the character is eliminated).

Normally, when a character leaves active play (e.g., is discarded or eliminated), all cards controlled by him are discarded. There are two major exceptions to this:

 - Sometimes, the card that causes the character to leave play allows him to transfer an item(s) (e.g., _Call of Home_).
 - lf a character is eliminated due to failing a body check, one item can be immediately transferred to each unwounded character in his company; but, the rest of his items are discarded.

### ACTIONS AND CARD PLAY

The various activities that you and your opponent can perform during play are called actions. Typical actions include playing a card, tapping a card, revealing a card, etc. The following general guidelines apply to resolving actions; more detailed guidelines can be found on [pages 69-70]().

 - You must give your opponent a chance to respond to every action, and vice versa. If you perform an action and move on to another action without giving your opponent a chance to respond, you must “back up” if he indicates that he wants to respond. A series of declared actions made in response to one another is called a "chain of effects." You always have the option of declaring the first action in a chain of effects during your turn. The actions in a chain of effects are resolved one at a time from last declared to first declared (i.e., the last declared action is resolved first, then the second to the last, etc.).
 - If the play of a card requires other actions (e.g., corruption checks), the actions are resolved in the order in which they appear on the card.
 - A required or declared dice roll is an action and can be the target of another action or effect declared later in the same chain of effects. Otherwise a card cannot be targeted until it resolves.
 - When the effects of a dice roll require further actions (e.g., a roll for a strike requires a body check), those actions become the first actions (any further rolls come first) in the next chain of effects after the roll.

# • PART II •<br>STANDARD RULES

You should read and master the Starter Rules before tackling the Standard Rules.

## 1 • THE VICTORY CONDITIONS

The Standard Rules victory conditions differ from those found in the Starter Rules in two ways. First, the players can decide to play a longer game, and/or second, certain modifications to the marshalling point totals can be made at the Free Council.

### THE LONGER GAMES

The Starter Game is also called the “1-deck game.” For experienced players with tuned decks, this game usually lasts 20-60 minutes. If you want longer, more detailed play, there are 3 other games.

#### The 2-deck Game

In a “2-deck game” (the “short game”), the Council is called when each play deck has been exhausted twice. You may call the Council when your play deck has been exhausted twice, or when it has been exhausted once and you have at least 25 marshalling points (MPs).

#### The 3-deck Game

In a “3-deck game” (the “long game”), the Council is called when each play deck has been exhausted three times. You may call the Council when your play deck has been exhausted three times, or when it has been exhausted twice and you have at least 30 marshalling points. Increase the sideboard size to 20 cards.

#### The 4-deck Game

In a “4-deck game” (i.e., the “campaign game”), the Council is called when each play deck has been exhausted four times. You may call the Council when your play deck has been exhausted four times, or when it has been exhausted three times and you have at least 40 marshalling points. Increase the sideboard size to 25 cards.

### MARSHALLING POINT MODIFICATIONS

At the Free Council, you may reveal any unique marshalling point cards in your hand that match unique cards that your opponent has in play. Each such revealed card reduces your opponent’s marshalling point total by one.

There are six different types of marshalling points; each is associated with a specific shape:

| Character Points | ![](/assets/images/charactermp.svg) | 
| Item Points (Major, Greater, & Rings only) | ![](/assets/images/itemmp.svg) | 
| Faction Points | ![](/assets/images/factionmp.svg) | 
| Ally Points | ![](/assets/images/allymp.svg) | 
| Kill Points (from defeating creatures) | ![](/assets/images/killmp.svg) | 
| Miscellaneous Points | ![](/assets/images/miscmp.svg) | 

These types of marshalling points can affect your marshalling point
total in two ways:

- If your opponent has zero (or negative) points for any one type of marshalling point, your points for that same type of marshalling point are doubled. This doesn’t apply to kill points and miscellaneous points.
- No more than half (round up) of your final marshalling points can come from any one type of marshalling point. If one type of marshalling point is over half of your total, reduce the points for that type until they are only half (or less) of your total.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** These marshalling point modifications do not apply until the Free Council actually takes place. Specifically, the modifications do not affect your marshalling point total when it is used to determine if you can call the Free Council (i.e., you need 20 MPs to call the Free Council before any of these modifications are made).
{: .note }
> **Example:** Let’s look again at our example from [page 11](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#the-free-council). Assume Jason failed to play the Men of Northern Rhovanion (3 MPs) on his last turn. Assume none of the characters failed a corruption check (i.e., they all come to the Free Council). 
> 
> Jessica notices that Jason has no faction points (he blew his roll to get the Men of Northern Rhovanion). So her faction points are doubled to 4. 
> 
> Unfortunately, Jason’s problems are not over. He failed to get the 3 MPs from the Men of Northern Rhovanion; so his MP total is only 14—8 of them are character points and only 6 are non-character points. Since you cannot have more than half of your points from any one source, Jason only gets 6 MPs from his characters.
> 
> At this point, the marshalling points (MPs) break down as follows:
> 
> | Jessica’s MP Cards | MPs | Modified MPs |
> | :--- | :---: | ---: |
> | Celeborn  |  2  |  2
> Elladan  |  1  |  1
> Elrohir  |  1  |  1
> Gildor Inglorion  |  1  |  1
> Legolas  |  2  |  2
> Sword of Gondolin (item)  |  2  |  2
> Men of Lebennin (faction)  |  2  |  4
> Gwaihir (ally)  |  2  |  2
> Dreams of Lore (misc)  |  2  |  2
> **Total**  | **15** |  **17**
> 
> | Jason’s MP Cards | MPs | Modified MPs |
> | :--- | :---: | ---: |
> Beorn  |  2  |  2
> Faramir  |  2  |  2
> Imrahil  |  2  |  2
> Theoden  |  2  |  0
> Sword of Gondolin (item)  |  2  |  2
> Great Shield of Rohan (item)  |  2  |  2
> Quickbeam (ally)  |  2  |  2
> **Total**  | **14**  | **12**
> 
> At this point, Jason reveals that he has cards for Gwaihir, Legolas, and Elrohir in his hand (he was saving them for this). Since they duplicate three of Jessica’s unique MP cards, her MP total is reduced by one for each of these cards. Thus, Jessica ends up with 14 MPs and Jason ends up with 12 MPs— Jessica wins. Jason curses his luck because he failed to bring the Men of Northern Rhovanion into play on his last turn.
## 2 • THE CARDS AND DECKS

In addition to the normal location deck and play deck, you can have a 15 card “sideboard” deck. A sideboard can contain resource, hazard, and character cards. However, the combined play deck and sideboard can only contain one of each unique card and a maximum of three of any non-unique card.

#### Using Your Sideboard When You Exhaust Your Deck

Whenever you exhaust your play deck, you may exchange (before reshuffling) up to 5 cards between your sideboard and discard pile. Each such card taken from your sideboard must be replaced by a card from your discard pile.

#### Using Your Sideboard When You Tap Your Wizard

During your organization phase, you may tap your Wizard to bring up to 5 resource and/or character cards from your sideboard into your discard pile.

Alternatively, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may tap your Wizard to bring one resource card directly from your sideboard into your play deck (reshuffle).

#### Using Your Sideboard When You Tap a Nazgul

During your opponent’s movement/hazard phase, you may tap one of your Nazgul permanent-events in play to bring up to 5 hazard cards from your sideboard into your discard pile. The normal result of tapping a Nazgul does not apply. The Nazgul is discarded. Tapping a Nazgul in this fashion does count against the hazard limit.

Alternatively, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may tap a Nazgul permanent-event to bring one hazard card directly from your sideboard into your play deck (reshuffle).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Your opponent may verify how many cards move to and from your sideboard, but you do not have to reveal what those cards are. 
> 
> **Clarification:** Your combined play deck and sideboard cannot violate the 1 unique card and 3 non-unique card limit. However, there is no restriction on the mix of hazards, resources, and characters in your sideboard. That is, for the purposes of your sideboard, you can ignore the play deck restrictions: the limit of 10 characters and the 50/50 resource/hazard mix.
## 3 • GETTING READY TO PLAY

Add your region cards to your location deck. See [pages 54-56](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#region-movement) for more information on how to use these cards.

{: .note }
> **Note:** For play balance, we recommend both players have access to approximately the same number of region cards. If this cannot be achieved, region cards should not be used.
## 4 • THE PLAYER TURN

The [Full Player Turn Summary](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#full-player-turn-summary) is presented on [pages 68-70](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#full-player-turn-summary).

## 5 • CHARACTERS & COMPANIES

There are several Standard Rules changes involving characters and companies.

#### Splitting a Company at a Non-Haven Site

During the organization phase, a company at a non-haven site may split into two or more companies. The following instructions apply:

 - One of the companies may remain at the current site.
 - One of the companies may return to the Haven site indicated by the current site’s site path.
 - Any other companies must move to different sites using region movement.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** These restrictions mean that two companies may not start at the same site and then move to the same site separately (i.e., in such a situation the two companies would have to move as one company). 
 
#### Joining Two Companies at a Non-Haven Site

During the organization phase, two companies may move to the same site, but one of the following cases must apply:

 - One and only one company may already be at the site. In this case the other company must state that its new site card is already in play (the current site card for the non-moving company).
 - One company moves to the site using the site path on that site card (i.e., the company starts at the site’s nearest Haven), and the other company moves to the site using region cards for its site path. In this case, both companies must state that the same face down site card is their new site card.

In both cases, the two companies must face hazards separately and are then combined at the end of the movement/hazard phase.

#### Discarding Characters

Instead of bringing a new character/Wizard into play during your organization phase, you may discard a character that is at a Haven or at his home site. A Wizard may not be discarded.

You must take this action when you are forced to discard a character due to a lack of available influence. In this case, the character(s) need not be at a Haven.

#### Bringing Characters into Play

Before you play your Wizard, you may use general influence to bring a character into play at any haven or at his home site. After revealing your Wizard, you may use general influence to bring a character into play only if your Wizard is at the site at which the character arrives (i.e., a Haven or the character’s home site).

## 6 • MOVEMENT

There are two ways to move from one site to another. A company can use the site path on a site card (see the Starter Rules) **or** it can use region cards as its site path to a specific site card (i.e., region
movement). 

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Region movement is not necessary to play this game. Region movement just gives you more options; i.e., with region movement a company need not move to a Haven every other turn. Region cards are not included in starter decks.
### REGION MOVEMENT

To use region movement, play a new site card (face down) and a series of up to four regions (face down) that connect the company’s current site with the new site (i.e., the company moves). A series of regions “connects” two sites if:

- The current (i.e., site of origin) site is located in the first region, **and**
- That region card is adjacent to the next region card played, **and**
- That region card is adjacent to the next region card played, … , **and**
- Finally, the last region card played is the region that the new site card is located in.

A region is adjacent to another region if and only if each region lists the other region on its card.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** To use region movement for a company, the region cards played must include the region containing the company’s current site and the region containing the new site. If both the current site and the new site are in the same region, only that region card need be played.
> 
> **Clarification:** If two sites are separated by more than four regions, a company may not travel directly between them in one turn (unless some special resource card is used, e.g., Bridge, Shadowfax, etc.). The company must first travel to interim sites (one per turn) until it reaches a site that is within four regions of the destination site.
> 
> **Clarification:** Certain regions may appear to be adjacent on the maps, but turn out not to be adjacent upon examination of the lists on their cards. For example, Dagorlad and Rohan appear to be adjacent on the maps, but they are really separated by the Anduin River.
#### Playing Hazards

For the purposes of playing hazards, the site path for a company using region movement is defined by the region types of the region cards played. You can use a creature hazard to _directly attack_ one of your opponent’s companies if at least one of the region types on the creature’s card matches that region type of a region card played by the company (two are required for creatures that require two symbols of the same type).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** Region movement can be more dangerous to use than normal movement—certain creatures can be played keyed to specific region cards.
> 
> For example, suppose you decide to move a company from Lorien to the Easterling Camp using the region cards: Wold & Foothills (![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg)), Brown Lands (![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg)), Dagorlad (![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg)), and Horse Plains (![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg)). The region types traveled through are the same as the site path used in normal movement between Lorien and the Easterling Camp (as given on the Easterling Camp site card)—so the same creatures may be played against the company based on region type. Adunaphel (a Nazgul) card normally can only be played keyed to dark-holds and dark-domains, but it also states that it can be played keyed to Dagorlad (and the Brown Lands). Thus, Adunaphel could be played on this company as it moves through Dagorlad. Similarly, Indur Dawndeath and Khamul the Easterling could also be played. 
{: .note }
> **Example:** Lets look at our example for movement from the Starter Game (see [page 26](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#moving-from-a-haven-site)). Jessica’s company in Bree (in the Arthedain region) wants to move to Thranduil’s Halls (in the Woodland Realm region) in order to bring the Wood-elves faction into play. If she does not use region movement, this takes three turns: Bree to Rivendell, Rivendell to Lorien, and Lorien to Thranduil’s Halls. Using region movement, she can do it in 2 turns. 
> 
> The shortest number of region cards required for this move is 5 and there are two possible routes:
> 
> - Arthedain ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), Rhudaur ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), High Pass ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), Anduin Vales ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg), Woodland Realm ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg).
> - Arthedain ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), Angmar ![](/assets/images/shadow-land.svg), Gundabad ![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg), Anduin Vales ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg), Woodland Realm ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg).
> 
> Jessica decides on the first, less dangerous route. However, it is more than 4 regions long, so her company must first move to another site along the way. Jessica looks at her hand and sees that she has a Precious Gold Ring, so she decides move to Gladden Fields (in the Anduin Vales) to try and get the ring on her way to Thranduil’s Halls (why waste a turn).
> 
> On her first turn, she moves to the Gladden Fields by playing the Gladden Fields site and the following regions: Arthedain ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), Rhudaur ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), High Pass ![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg), Anduin Vales ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg). 
> 
> On her second turn, she moves to Thranduil’s Halls by playing the Thranduil’s Halls site and the following regions: Anduin Vales ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg), Woodland Realm ![](/assets/images/border-land.svg).
 
## 7 • COMBAT
An _untapped_ character that is not the target of a strike may tap to support a character in the same company that is the target of a strike. The target’s prowess is modified by +1 for each supporting character.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If a character is assigned a strike from an attack, he may **not** tap to support a character that is facing a strike from the same attack. An ally may tap to give a +1 prowess modification in this manner. 
{: .note }
> **Example:** A Cave Drake (two strikes, 10/–) attacks your company which consists of the untapped characters: Bilbo, Balin, Bofur, Beretar, and Beregond.
> 
> You opponent assigns the two strikes to Bilbo and Balin. You play a Halfling Stealth to cancel the strike against Bilbo. Balin is carrying the Arkenstone, so you really want to keep him alive. You tap Balin to face the attack, and you tap Bofur and Beregond to support him. You would also like to tap Bilbo for support, but you cannot—he was assigned a strike, so he is still a target of this attack. Balin has a prowess of 6 versus this attack: 4 (his own prowess) + 1 (Bofur’s support) + 1 (Beregond’s support).
## 8 • CORRUPTION

Before the roll is made for a corruption check, you may tap other characters in the same company as the character making the check. The corruption check is modified by +1 for each such character and/or Wizard tapped. 

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If more than one character in a company are forced to make corruption checks, the corruption checks are resolved one at a time in an order chosen by the player controlling the characters. Each character tapped may only give a +1 modification to one corruption check, **not** to all of the corruption checks.
> 
> **Clarification:** When the Free Council is called, a character may only tap to give a +1 corruption check modification to another character in the same company.
{: .note }
> **Example:** Your company consists of the untapped characters: Bilbo, Balin, Bofur, Beretar, and Beregond. A Weariness of the Heart is played on Balin, requiring him to make a corruption check.
> 
> Balin is carrying the Arkenstone (4 corruption points) and some Healing Herbs (1 corruption point), so you tap Bilbo and Beregond to help him with his corruption check. Balin has a corruption point total of 5, but his roll is modified by +2 (+1 for Bilbo and +1 for Beregond). He will only fail if he rolls 3 or less.
## 9 • INFLUENCE

Influence is the only way that your characters can directly affect your opponent’s resources. During your site phase, one and only one of your characters may tap to attempt to influence away one of your opponent’s characters, followers, allies, factions, or items. This may only take place if the influencing character and the target of the influence are at the same site. If you successfully influence the target, it is discarded. In some cases, you may reveal an identical card and attempt to play it (i.e., he convinces the target to join his side). Such an influence attempt may not be made on the first turn, and a Wizard may not make such an attempt on the turn he is revealed.

#### Influencing an Opponent’s Character

To attempt to influence one of your opponent’s non-Wizard characters you must make an influence check. You make a roll (2D6) and:

 - Add the influencing character’s unused direct influence.
 - Subtract your opponent’s unused general influence points.
 - Subtract the result of a roll (2D6) made by your opponent .
 - Add any other modifications (from cards and special abilities). All modification cards must be played before making the roll.

If the modified result is greater than the target’s mind attribute, the target character card and all of the non-follower cards he controls are discarded. Otherwise, nothing happens.

If you reveal an identical character card from your hand before making the roll for the influence check, the target character’s mind attribute is treated as if it were zero. If the attempt is unsuccessful, you must discard the character card you revealed. If such an influence check is successful, the target character and his non-follower cards are discarded **and** the revealed character card may be immediately played (appearing at the same site). In order to play this character, you must have enough unused general influence to control him **or** an influencing character at the same site must have enough direct influence.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If you reveal an identical character in order to nullify the target character’s mind attribute for an influence check, you must discard that character if you do not play him.
{: .note }
> **Example:** Jessica and Jason each have one company organized as follows: 
> 
> ```mermaid
> %%{init: {'flowchart' : {'curve' : 'linear'}, 'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#fff','primaryBorderColor': '#44434d','fontFamily': 'timesnewroman'}}}%%

>     GI("Jessica's General Influence (-•20)") 
>     GI --- Ell("Elladan (6•0)")
>     GI --- Leg("Legolas (6•2+2)")
>     Leg --- Elr("Elrohir (4•0)")
>     GI ---Cel("Celeborn (6•1)")
>     Pal("Pallando (-•10)") --- Gil("Gildor<br>Inglorion (4•0)")
> ```
> 
> ```mermaid
> %%{init: {'flowchart' : {'curve' : 'linear'}, 'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#fff','primaryBorderColor': '#44434d','fontFamily': 'timesnewroman'}}}%%
> graph TD
>     GI("Jason's General Influence (-•20)") 
>     GI --- The("Theoden (6•3)")
>     GI --- Far("Faramir (5•1)")
>     GI --- Imr("Imrahil (6•2)")
>     Rad("Radagast (-•10)") --- Beo("Beorn (7•2)")
> ```
> 
> Jessica moves her company to the same site as Jason’s company. During her site phase, Pallando attempts to influence Faramir. Jessica has 4 unused general influence, Jason has 3 unused general influence, and Pallando has 6 unused direct influence. Jessica rolls 2D6 and gets a 8, while Jason rolls 2D6 and gets a 7. So the modified result of the influence check is 4 = 8 (Jessica’s roll) + 6 (Pallando’s unused direct influence) - 3 (Jason’s unused general influence) - 7 (Jason’s roll). This result is not greater than Faramir’s mind attribute of 5, so Faramir is not influenced and remains in play. If Jessica had rolled a 10 or higher, Faramir would have been discarded.
> 
> If Jessica had revealed a Faramir card from her hand before the rolls were made, his mind attribute would have been zero for the purposes of this roll. In this case, the influence check would have been successful—Jason would have discarded his Faramir card and Jessica would have played her Faramir card. He must be played as Pallando’s follower because she only has 4 unused general influence.
> 
> In the case in which Faramir is influenced, Jessica should not celebrate too much. During his turn, Jason can shift Beorn to control by general influence and then use Radagast’s 10 unused general influence points to attempt to influence one of Jessica’s characters.
#### Influencing an Opponent’s Ally

To influence an opponent’s ally, you must make an influence check as outlined above. However, the following exceptions apply:

 - Instead of the controlling character’s mind attribute, the influence check uses the ally’s mind attribute.
 - The result is also modified by the “unused direct influence” of the character controlling the ally. 
 - Revealing an identical ally card reduces the ally’s mind attribute to 0 and allows you to play the card if the influence check is successful.

#### Influencing an Opponent’s Follower

To influence an opponent’s follower, you must make an influence check as outlined above. However, the result is also modified by subtracting the “unused direct influence” of the follower’s controlling character.

#### Influencing an Opponent’s Faction

To influence an opponent’s faction, you must make an influence check as outlined above. However, the following exceptions apply:

 - Instead of a mind attribute, the influence check uses the value usually required to bring the faction into play (as given on the faction’s card).
 - The influence check is modified by any of the faction’s applicable “Standard Modifications” (as given on the faction’s card).
 - Revealing an identical faction card reduces the the value usually required to bring the faction into play to zero and allows you to play that card if the influence check is successful. 

You may only influence an opponent’s factions if the influencing character is at the site where the faction was played. 
 
#### Influencing an Opponent’s Item

To influence an opponent’s item, you must make an influence check as outlined above. However, the following exceptions apply:

 - The mind attribute of the character controlling the item is used.
 - The result is also modified by subtracting the “unused direct influence” of the item’s controlling character.
 - You _must_ reveal an identical item card in order to make an influence attempt on an item (i.e., you are attempting to convince the controlling character that the item would be more useful to the cause of the Free Peoples in your hands). If the influence check is successful, you may play your card with the character that made the influence check—if you choose not to play the item, discard it.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The unused direct influence for an influence check against an item **is** affected by any direct influence modification that the target item gives its bearer.
## 10 • PLAYING AND DRAWING CARDS

There are several Standard Rules changes involving playing cards.

### LIMITS ON DRAWING CARDS

During your turn, you may draw cards based on one of your moving companies only if the company contains a Wizard or at least one character with a mind attribute of three or more.

### PLACING A CARD ON-GUARD

During the movement/hazard phase of your opponent’s turn, you may place one card on-guard for each of your opponent’s companies. This card is played face down next to the company’s new site or next to its current site if it did not move. Any card can be placed on-guard (i.e., it does not have to be a hazard, you can bluff). Such a card does count against the hazard limit for the company it is placed on. The card will remain on that site until one of the following occurs:

 - _The company decides to face the site’s automatic-attack_. If the onguard card is a hazard creature keyed to the company’s site **or** a hazard that can modify the automatic-attack, it may be revealed before the automatic-attack is resolved. If it is a hazard creature, it will attack after the automatic-attack is resolved.
 - _The company plays a card keyed to the site_. If the on-guard card is a non-creature hazard, it may be revealed if it is a hazard that directly affects the company or a character in the company (e.g., a hazard that forces all characters to make a corruption check).
 - Otherwise, return the card to your hand at the end of the site phase. 
 
In the first two cases, the card is handled as if it had been played during the movement-hazard phase (i.e., short-events are discarded, long-events last until your opponent’s next long-event phase, etc.).

{: .note }
> **Example:** After visiting Thranduil’s Halls, Jessica’s company moves to The Lonely Mountain. During her movement/hazard phase, Jason places a card on-guard. The card is Awaken Denizens, but Jessica does not know that. This card doubles the # of strikes for an automatic-attack at a Ruins & Lairs site.
> 
> During her site phase, Jessica states that her company will face The Lonely Mountain’s automatic-attack (a Dragon, 1 strike with a prowess of 14). Jason reveals his on-guard card and the automatic-attack becomes 2 strikes with a prowess of 14 each. Jessica’s company must face this attack (it may be canceled).
> 
> Suppose Jason had placed a Cave Drake on-guard. Then Jessica’s company would have to face the automatic-attack and then the Cave Drake. 
> 
> Suppose Jason had placed a Weariness of the Heart on-guard. Then, if Jessica’s company successfully faced the automatic-attack and played an item, Jason could reveal the Weariness of the Heart to force any one character in the company to make a corruption check. 
 
#### Dice Roll Timing
Before a roll is made for combat or a check, cards may be played that will modify the result of the roll. However, once the roll is actually made, no further cards may be played that modify the dice roll result. This modified result is used to determine _effects_ of the combat or check before any other actions are taken. When the effects of a dice roll require other actions (e.g., a successful strike requires a body check) those actions become the initial actions (any further rolls come first) in the next chain of effects after the roll.

#### Timing Rules

You and your opponent may both want to perform actions at the same time or actions that are sequenced with respect to other actions. This can happen during your movement/hazard phase (or during your site phase if your opponent has a card on-guard). Such actions almost always include playing a card, tapping a card already in play, and revealing an on-guard card.

Your opponent may always declare an action in response before your action is resolved. Then, you may respond to his action, and he can respond to your second action, and so on until neither player can (or wants to) perform an action.

You must give your opponent a chance to respond to every action, and vice versa. If you perform an action and move on to another action without giving your opponent a chance to respond, you must “backup” if he indicates that he wants to respond.

Such a series of declared actions is called a chain of effects. You always have the option of declaring the first action in a chain of effects during your turn. The actions in a chain of effects are resolved one at a time from last declared to first declared (i.e., the last declared action is resolved first, then the second to the last, etc.).

You may follow one of your declared actions with another of your declared actions in the same chain of effects, so long as you give your opponent a chance to respond to first action. 

An action in a chain of effects is negated if the conditions required to perform it are negated by another action that is resolved before it in the chain of effects.

{: .note }
> **Timing Example:** You play Weariness of the Heart on Bilbo to force him to make a corruption check. Your opponent taps Frodo (2nd action in this chain of effects) to give Bilbo +1 to this check. You play Call of Home on Bilbo (3rd action), which forces Bilbo to make a successful roll or return to his owner’s hand. Finally, your opponent plays Tookish Blood on Bilbo. This cancels any effect for the rest of the turn which would discard Bilbo or send him to his owner’s hand. Now you resolve actions from last to first:
> - Tookish Blood takes effect.
> - Call of Home takes effect, but Tookish Blood negates any effect it would have.
> - Frodo gives +1 to Bilbo’s corruption check (an action can target a dicerolling action that was declared earlier in the same chain of effects, even though the dice-rolling action has not taken effect).
> - Bilbo makes his corruption check—he rolls the dice adding +1 to his roll because of Frodo’s help (other modifications not discussed here). Tookish Blood cancels any result of this corruption check that would discard Bilbo.
>
> If your opponent had played Tookish Blood on Bilbo after his dice roll, i.e. after this chain of effects was resolved, it would not have affected your Call of Home nor Bilbo’s corruption check. Tookish Blood only cancels those actions that occur during the rest of the turn, and not prior actions.
>
> Consider if Tookish Blood had not been played and if you played Call of Home on Frodo. First Frodo rolls for Call of Home when resolving the chain. If he fails this check, Frodo goes back to your opponent’s hand. The 2nd action in the chain would then be negated because the conditions required to perform it, namely Frodo being in Bilbo’s company, were negated by your Call of Home.
# • PART III •<br/>OPTIONAL RULES

Each of these optional rules may be used if all players agree before the game begins.

**Special Movement to Gorgoroth Rules** — A company may only move to or from a site in Gorgoroth (e.g., Barad-dur, Mount Doom) by using one of the following:
 - Specific region movement from a site in Imlad Morgul (Cirith Ungol, Minas Morgul, or Shelob’s Lair).
 - Specific region movement that passes through Nurn or Udun.

**Burglaring** — A Hobbit may attempt to “burglar” at an untapped site. If you decide to make a burglary attempt, make a roll. If the result is greater than 5, the Hobbit taps the site without facing the automatic-attack and may tap to play an item that is playable at that site. Otherwise, the Hobbit faces the automatic-attack alone.

**Recently Visited Sites** — If a site is in the opponent’s discard pile, the number of strikes and prowess for the site’s automatic-attack are increased by 1.

**Tapping to Face Multiple Strikes** — A character can tap, take a -3 mod, and face two strikes.

### MULTI-PLAYER RULES

Except for the guidelines presented in this section, a multi-player game (3-5 players) uses the normal rules.

**Victory Conditions:** The normal rules are used for victory conditions and to determine when the game ends. However, when a player calls the Free Council, each of the other players gets to take one final turn. If a player’s Wizard is eliminated, that player is out of the game; however, the game only ends in this manner if only one player is left in the game. The doubling of your marshalling points based on a MP type only applies if none of your opponents has a card in play of that type.

**Getting Ready to Play:** Before the players set up their decks for play, each player makes a roll (reroll all ties). When play starts, the second highest roller will sit to the left of the high roller, the third highest roller will sit to the left of the second highest roller, etc.

The highest roller chooses the Wizard he will play, the second highest roller chooses his Wizard from the remaining Wizards, etc. Each player may place up to two of his Wizard cards in his play deck.

At this point each player should have his play deck constructed. For multi-player games, half (round up) of the hazards in your play deck must be hazard creatures.

Each player should select a character pool of up to 25 characters. The _low_ roller reveals a character from his pool; this character starts in play. Then, the player to the right of the low roller reveals a starting character that has not already been revealed. This process continues in a counter-clockwise direction until all players have revealed their starting characters as outlined in the normal rules (i.e., 1-5 characters with a 20 or less mind attribute total). Then, each player may place up to 10 characters from their character pool into their play decks.

After the characters are all revealed, each player may exchange up to three cards between his play deck and his cards not being used (all normal play deck restrictions must be met).

The highest roller takes his turn first. Then, the player to his left takes his turn, and so on (i.e., play proceeds clockwise). 

**The Player Turn:** Your “hazard-opponent” for the purposes of hazards is the player to your left. During your Long-event Phase, you remove your own resource long-events and the hazard long-events belonging to your hazard-opponent. Only your hazard-opponent may draw cards (based on the site being moved to) and play hazards during your movement/hazard phase. A player only has the option of discarding a card during an End-of-Turn Phase if it is his own turn or if it is his hazard-opponent’s turn.

Twilight cards can be played at any time by any player. Permanent-events, long-events, and other “global” events (e.g., tapping Ren the Unclean) affect all players.

_Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion_ provides some expanded, variant multi-player rules.

### SOLITAIRE RULES

**Getting Started:** Place all of your hazard cards in one shuffled deck. (_Variant #1_: Have someone construct a hazard deck for you. _Variant #2_: Construct several “well-tuned” hazard decks of approximately cards each, then play against each one.) Your play deck has no hazards and must have at least 30 cards. Your hand size is only five cards. 

**During Play:** Proceed normally, except for the following exceptions. There is no opponent’s player turn. Whenever you would draw or discard to get a hand of 8 cards, you now draw or discard to get a hand of 5 cards. During the movement/hazard phase, you draw and discard normally for each company.

**Playing Hazards:** During the movement/hazard phase, for each company, you draw hazard cards equal to 2 plus twice the number of hazard cards normally drawn for that site. Then you must play as many of those hazard cards as you can within the hazard limit for the company. You should play the hazards in the fashion that is most disadvantageous for your companies. Any cards requiring _Doors of Night_ are saved and played when a _Doors of Night_ is drawn. 

**Object of the Game:** The object of the solitaire game is to accumulate as many marshalling points (MPs) as you can by the time you exhaust your play deck for the second time. 

_Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion_ provides some expanded, variant solitaire rules.

## FULL PLAYER TURN SUMMARY

### Untap Phase

Each of your characters may do one of the following:
 - Untap **or**
 - Heal (if at a Haven site).
 
Untap all of your other tapped non-site cards.

### Organization Phase

The following actions may be taken in any order:

 - Play a character card **or** a Wizard card (if allowable).
 - Reorganize your characters at the same Haven into any number of companies.
 - Shift your characters between being controlled by general influence and being controlled by direct influence.
 - Transfer items between your characters at the same site. A corruption check is required for the character giving up an item.
 - Store items or other designated resources from your companies at a Haven site **or** at sites specified on the item cards. A corruption check is required for the character giving up an item.
 - Each of your companies may do one of the following:
      - Stay at its current site.
      - Play another site (face down) that can be moved to (i.e., reached) directly from the company’s current site. This is the company’s new site card.
      - _Standard Rules Only:_ Play a new site card and a series of up to four specific regions that connect the current site with the new site. (See [pages 54-56](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#region-movement).)

### Long-event Phase

First, remove all of your resource long-events already in play.

Then, play any new resource long-event cards.

Finally, remove all of your opponent’s hazard long-events.

### Movement/Hazard Phase

Follow this procedure for each of your companies. You decide which of your companies goes first, second, etc.:

 1. If the company has a face down site card (i.e., its new site card), turn it over. Your company’s current site becomes its _site of origin_.
 2. If the company is not moving, no cards are drawn. If the company is moving to a non-haven site, you _may_ draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that it is _moving to_ (at least one card must be drawn); your opponent does the same. If the company is moving to a haven site, you _may_ draw up to the number of cards indicated by the site that it is _moving from_ (at least one card must be raw); your opponent does the same.
 3. Your opponent plays hazards on the company—each hazard is resolved as indicated in its text. These hazards are played and resolved one at a time and in some cases may not directly affect the company. A hazard may not be played if it targets a different company or a character in a different company.<br>If the company is not moving, hazard creatures may only be keyed to the company’s site of origin. Hazard creatures must be “keyed to” the moving company’s site path and/or new site. If a creature is keyed to more than one region type and/or site type that applies, your opponent decides which one is used.<br>The maximum number of hazards that may be played on a company during a given movement/hazard phase (i.e., the hazard limit) is equal to the size of the company _or_ two, whichever is larger (Hobbits count half, round up). The hazard limit is determined for each company at the beginning of the movement/hazard phase (e.g., it remains fixed).
 4. If the company has been required to return to its site of origin, return the new site card to the location deck (or discard if it is tapped) and proceed to step 6 (the site of origin becomes its current site). No additional hazards may be played on that company.
 5. Remove the company’s site of origin (i.e., the site the company came from). Discard the site card if it is tapped and not a Haven. Otherwise, return it to the location deck. At this point, the company is considered to have arrived at the new site (i.e., its new site becomes its site of origin). _Standard Rules Only:_ Return any region cards to the location deck.
 6. You must discard any cards in excess of eight in your hand; your opponent does the same for his hand. If you have fewer than eight cards, you must draw cards until your hand has eight cards; your opponent does the same for his hand. 

**Note:** _Repeat steps 1-6 for each of your companies._

### Site Phase

In the order you decide (i.e., you decide which goes first, second, etc.), each of your companies at an _untapped_ site may:

 - do nothing **or**
 - follow this procedure:
      1. You decide to enter and explore the site.
      2. If the site has an automatic-attack, it attacks the company. The attack is resolved normally (see [pages 29-33](/rules-archive/the-wizards-unlimited#7--combat)).
      3. The company may attempt to play one item, ally, faction, or information resource card that is “playable” at that site. Generally, this will involve tapping the character that will control the card played. If the resource card is successfully played, the site card is tapped **and** one additional character may tap to play a minor item.<br>Certain resource cards other than items, allies, factions, and information will state the conditions under which they may be played. Such cards may be played at tapped and untapped sites, and do not tap a site when played (e.g., _Return of the King_, _Lucky Search_, etc.).<br>
      _Standard Rules Only:_ One of your characters or your Wizard may attempt to influence away one of your opponent’s characters, followers, allies, factions, or items (if it is at the same site).

**End-of-Turn Phase**
You may discard one card. Then you must draw or discard cards until your hand has 8 cards. Your opponent does the same.

[^bullets]: These online rules are not formatted with a line of bullets as a sidebar. See the pdf version of the rules to review this feature.
[^twopaths]: This rule states that each Darkhaven has two site paths, which is not the case as previously mentioned in the _MELE_ rules. This text appears to be a holdover from _The Wizards_ rules which was not updated for _The Lidless Eye_.
[^borderregions]: This phrase "usually in Border regions" appeared in the Limited version of _The Wizards_ rules but was taken out and not present in the Unlimited version—Border-holds are not _usually_ in "Border regions" (Border-lands), they are usually in Wilderness. However, this statement returned for _The Lidless Eye_ rules in a position within the sentence.
[^factionmppile]: In _METW_ factions are placed in the play area. This rule in _MELE_ states that factions are placed in your marshalling point pile, not the play area. In Section 2 of _MELE_ there is a diagram showing that factions are in play, not in the marshalling point pile and section 10 states that factions are played into the play area. The _Challenge Deck_ and _The Balrog_ Rules Summary also state that factions are placed into the marshalling point pile. However, some of the cards that are played on factions (e.g., Trouble on All Borders, No Escape from my Magic, etc.) specifically state "a faction in play." The reason that factions were played into the play area in the first place is that the Designers hoped to make more use out of factions. There was an expansion in development called _War Hosts_ which would allow factions to battle across the map. However, these mechanics were deemed to be too clunky in a game focusing on small groups of companies traveling the map. _Dark Minions_ was released instead and _War Hosts_ got pushed back until it was abandoned. Presumably the abandonment of _War Hosts_ meant that factions could simply go into the MP pile. However, the MP pile is out of play and so cards cannot be played on "factions in play." This led to rules changes in Section 2. Unlike in _METW_ where the MP pile and out-of-play pile are out of play, _MELE_ makes a distinction between "inactive" and "active" play. However, "inactive" play is never defined. In the end, the same result achieved a different way. At least, ICE has never defined any mechanical difference between the _METW_ way of playing factions into the play area and the _MELE_ way of placing the factions into the MP pile besides changing the place were factions end up after being played.
