# MIDDLE-EARTH: THE BALROG

{: .text-center }
Rules Summary & Play Tips

## INTRODUCTION

There are two different _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ (_MEBA_) boxes—The Shadow-deeps (reddish) and the Balrog's Host (bluish). Together, these two boxes contain at least one copy of each of the 104 _MEBA_ expansion cards. So, if you have purchased both boxes, you have a complete set of the MEBA cards.

Each _MEBA_ box contains all of the cards for a preconstructed _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_) deck—everything you need, except for a pair of dice, to challenge any opponent to a fun and competitive match of _MECCG_.

This rulesbook has four parts:

 - The specific rules for _MEBA_
 - The play tips and deck lists for the two preconstructed _MEBA_ decks
 - The _MECCG_ rules summary
 - The card diagrams and Middle-earth map

# SPECIFIC RULES FOR MIDDLE-EARTH: THE BALROG

This is an expansion set of over 100 cards for the _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_. While it is fully compatible with both _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ and _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_, _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ focuses on a player using resources from _The Lidless Eye_.

The Balrog is supremely confident of his own immense personal power. After all, just like Sauron, he was one of Morgoth's chief lieutenants. The Balrog tends to rely on brute force and direct confrontation rather than more subtle approac hes ofte n used by Ringwraiths and Wizards. His goals are basic and simple—accumulate power and destroy his enemies. If he can do this, he can become a dominant power in Middle-earth—a factor to which both the Dark Lord and the Free Peoples will be forced react.

{: .note }
> **Note:** _Middle-earth: The Balrog_ introduces a new classification of creatures called "Spawn." These monstrous creatures were created by Morgoth or other fallen spirits. Like the Balrog, a few Spawn survived the War of the Wrath and hid deep underground.

## A BALROG PLAYER

A Balrog player acts as a Ringwraith player. Any card and rules text applying to a Ringwraith also applies to The Balrog (e.g., if a card refers to a Ringwraith, it now applies to "a Ringwraith or The Balrog").

However, instead of using the special rules listed on page 19 of this booklet (or on page 59 of the _MELE_ rules), a Balrog player uses the following special rules:

 - Any ring in The Balrog's company at the beginning of the end-of-turn phase is automatically tested. Any ring test in The Balrog's company is a modified by -2.
 - The Balrog may carry items (including rings) but may not use them (i.e., an item has no effect on The Balrog's company or on his attributes and abilities).
 - The Balrog never makes corruption checks and corruption cards may not be played on The Balrog.
 - Normally, The Balrog may not use starter and region movement (as stated on his card). However, the play of certain resources can expand his movement capabilities.
 - The Balrog's company is always overt.

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

As a Balrog player, you may win in the same way a _MELE_ Ringwraith wins: your opponent is eliminated **or** you recover _The One Ring_ **or** you have the most marshalling points at the Audience with Sauron. The following exceptions apply:

 - In order to win by recovering _The One Ring_, at least one _Challenge the Power_ card must be played and the conditions outlined on that card must be met.
 - The Audience with Sauron is handled normally, and victory is determined in the standard way by comparing marshalling points. However, to you (The Balrog) it is called your **Day of Decision** and your marshalling points reflect how far you have progressed towards taking your true place in Middle-earth. You must
play _Sudden Call_ to call your Day of Decision.

## GETTING READY TO PLAY

A Balrog player prepares for play just as a Ringwraith player does, with the following exceptions:

#### Declaring that You Are a Balrog Player

If you include The Balrog card (the character card with the special reddish background) in your deck or sideboard, you are a "Balrog player." In this case, you must tell your opponent before choosing starting companies.

{: .note }
> **Note**: You and your opponent may both be Balrog players, but the winner will probably the first player to get his Balrog into play.

#### Your Location Deck and Sites

Your location deck may include one copy of each of the minion site cards with the following exceptions:

 - Instead of the normal minion site cards use the Balrog specific site cards for:
      - Moria, Carn Dum, Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul
      - All Under-deeps site cards
      - All Dark-holds (Barad-dur, Cirith Ungol, Cirith Gorgor)
 - Since they are your only Darkhavens, The Under-gates and Moria are the only site cards that you may include multiple copies of in your location deck.
 - Geann a-Lisch is a Ruins & Lairs with no Darkhaven effects.

#### Your Starting Company, Play Deck, and Sideboard

Your starting company and play deck (and your sideboard) may be constructed like any other Ringwraith's—with the following exceptions:

 - Only Orc, Troll, Dragon, Wolf, and Animal factions may be included.
 - Only Orc and Troll minion characters may be included.
 - Unless they are "Balrog specific," only Orc and Troll characters with a mind less than 9 may be included.
 - "Balrog specific" cards may be included. Such cards may only be included in a Balrog player's deck. Playing
"Balrog specific" cards does not require that The Balrog be in play, only that you are a Balrog player.
 - Agents only count as hazards, not as characters.
 - A Balrog player may not include any of the following cards:

| Above the Abyss<br>Bade to Rule<br>The Balrog (Ally)<br>Balrog of Moria<br>The Black Council<br>Black Horse<br>Black Rider<br>By the Ringwraith 's Word<br>Creature of Another World<br>Fell Rider<br>The Fiery Blade<br>Helm of Fear<br>Heralded Lord<br>Durin 's Bane | Kill All But NOT the Halflings <br>The Lidless Eye<br>Morgul-blade<br>News of the Shire<br>Open to the Summons<br>Orders From Lugburz<br>Padding Feet<br>The Ring Leaves its Mark<br>Ringwraith cards<br>Ringwraith Unleashed cards<br>Sauron<br>They Ride Together<br>Use Your Legs<br>While the Yellow Face Sleeps |

#### Starting Site 

You may have up to two starting companies—they may begin play at Moria **and/or** The Under-gates.

## MOVEMENT

There are three types of basic movement in _MECCG_: starter movement, region movement, and Under-deeps
movement.

 - Balrog companies can never use starter movement.
 - When one of your Balrog companies moves to a site, you and your opponent draw cards based upon the site being moved to. This applies even if moving to one of your Darkhavens.

## CHARACTERS AND COMPANIES

 - The Balrog must come into play at The Under-gates (i.e., he may not come into play at Moria).
 - Characters with a home site of "Any Dark-hold" have a home site of "Any non-Dark-hold Under-deeps site" instead.
 - During his organization phase, a Balrog player may bring into play (and/or remove from play) up to two characters—the second character must be non-unique. The normal requirements for bringing into play (or removing from play) a character must still be met.
 - When a Balrog player brings into play a non-unique character with a mind of 3 or less, that character may come from his hand, his discard pile, or his sideboard.
 - Agents may not be played as characters.

## MISCELLANEOUS

 - If you are a Balrog player, your opponent may not play any of the following cards: _The Balrog_ (Ally), _The Black Council_, _Durin's Bane_, _Balrog of Moria_, _Reluctant Final Parting_.<br>&emsp;However, if at any time your opponent has one ofthese cards in his hand, he may remove it from play and bring a card from his sideboard into his play deck.
 - Rings are not automatically tested for a Balrog player at Barad-dur.
 - A Balrog player may not store anything at Barad-dur.
 - _Shelob_, _Spider of Morlat_, and _Balrog of Moria_ are Spawn.
 - A non-Balrog player cannot use Balrog sites. However, for the purposes of playing certain hazards, a non-Balrog player's location deck may include one copy each of: Ancient Deep-hold, The Wind-deeps, The Drowning Deeps, The Rusted-deeps, and Remains of Thangorodrim (i.e., the Balrog sites for which there is no corresponding hero or minion site).
 - If The Balrog is in play or has been defeated, ignore all Balrog automatic-attacks (i.e., at The Under-gates).

## DEFEATING A PERMANENT-EVENT (Clarification)

Certain hazard permanent-events indicate that they give "kill" marshalling points (e.g., Dragon "Ahunt" and "At Home" cards, the "Spawn" hazards from _ME: The Balrog_, etc.). Each of these cards has an attack associated with it. If such an attack is defeated, treat the associated card as a defeated creature.

## CARDS WITH MULTIPLE ACTIONS (Clarification)

If a card specifies that more than one action occurs when the card is itself resolved in a chain of effects, all of these actions are to be resolved in the card's chain of effects uninterrupted and in the order listed on the card. No actions may be declared to occur between these multiple actions. The actions listed on the card are considered to have been declared in the reverse order as they are printed. As an exception, if one of the effects of a card is an attack, cards may be played that cancel the attack, cancel one of the strikes, or that otherwise are playable during the strike sequence.

## PLACEMENT OF CARDS "OFF TO THE SIDE" (Clarification)

Certain cards and effects require other cards be placed "off to the side" (e.g., _Press Gang_). Cards placed off to the side are placed on the playing surface, usually off to the side of the normal area of play. Such cards are kept with their host permanent-event that caused this effect. Any such card absolutely cannot be targeted or otherwise affected by the game except by cards that specifically affect cards placed "off to the side." 

Cards placed off to the side are only in play for the purposes of uniqueness. Unless stated otherwise, when a host permanent-event is removed from the playing surface, any cards placed off to the side under it are discarded. Usually the host card will state a mechanic that affects the cards placed off to the side with it. Unless stated otherwise on its host card, a card placed off to the side will give its marshalling points to its owner. As a major exception, "taking prisoners" cards (primarily from _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_) yield negative marshalling points for characters taken prisoner.

## DISCARDING CARDS (Clarification)

When a card leaves active play (discarded, eliminated, returned to hand, etc.), discard all cards played on it.

## TOURNAMENT RULES

 - Spawn hazard permanent-events count as half a creature for the Council of Lorien 12-creature minimum.
 - A Balrog player has an extra +5 general influence that cannot be used to control characters.

## THE UNDER-DEEPS

{: .note }
> **Note:** Created by streams of molten rock and expanded by geothermal eruptions of super-hot gas, the Under-deeps are a result of a combination of natural and supernatural forces. The hand of Morgoth joined what was once a collection of sundered cavern complexes. His greater servants used this maze of tunnels
and chambers to travel surreptitiously throughout Endor.
>
> Although Endor changed during the Elder Days, the core of the Under-deeps survive. Travel between the underground sites is now difficult, if not impossible, for all but the greatest (and luckiest) explorers. Blocked or twisting away from their original course, the Under-deeps seem broken. Junctions and strongholds
seem lost. Many appear as simple caves or side passages. Others lie hidden behind veils of rock. Nearly all are still there, though, awaiting discovery.

An Under-deeps site card has "Under-deeps" in the section that normally gives the site's region. An Underdeeps site is just like any other site with the following exceptions:

 - Unlike other sites, each Under-deeps site is **not** considered to be in a region—instead it is located below another site, called the Under-deeps site's _surface site_.
 - Instead of a nearest Haven, each Under-deeps site lists all of its "Adjacent Sites." Each Under-deeps site is adjacent to its one surface site and a number of other Under-deeps sites. The first adjacent site listed is always the Under-deeps site's surface site.
 - _Eagle-mounts_ and _Gwaihir_ cannot be used to move to or from an Under-deeps site.
 - A company moving to and/or from an Under-deeps site has no site path. So, hazards may only be played keyed to the company's new site.
 - An environment card that changes site type (e.g., _Choking Shadows_, _Quiet Lands_, etc.) cannot be used to change the site type of an Under-deeps site.
 - _Unless you are a Balrog player_, you may not consider marshalling points associated with a company at an Under-deeps site for the purposes of calling the Free Council, Audience with Sauron, or Day of Decision.
 - Normally, when you successfully play an item, faction, ally, or information at a site, the site card is tapped and another character may tap to play a minor item. At an Under-deeps site, you can play any item playable at the site instead of this minor item.
 - For the purposes of playing hazards, a Free-hold is never considered to be the surface site of an Underdeeps site. 

{: .note }
> **Example:** Azog taps and plays _High Helm_ (a major item) at The Gem-deeps and the site taps. Then, a Hill-troll in Azog's company could tap to play a minor item at a non-Under-deeps site. But The Gemdeeps is an Under-deeps site, so the Hill-troll can tap to play any item playable at The Gem-deeps: a minor item, a major item, or a gold ring. He taps and plays _A Little Gold Ring_.

#### Under-deep Site Movement

One of your companies that begins its turn at the surface site of an Under-deeps site can move normally _or_ it can move to its adjacent Under-deeps site (i.e., the company moves to an Under-deeps site from its surface site). One of your companies that begins its turn at an Under-deeps site may only move to one of the adjacent sites listed on the Under-deeps site card.

Each adjacent site is followed by a number in parentheses—this number indicates how difficult it is to move from the Under-deeps site to the adjacent site. When an adjacent site is revealed by one of your companies whose site of origin is an Under-deeps site, you must make a roll (2D6). If the result is greater than or equal to the number in parentheses following the adjacent site as listed on its site of origin, the movement/hazard phase proceeds normally. Otherwise, the company returns to its site of origin (no cards are drawn) and the movement/hazard phase proceeds as if the company had not moved.

{: .note }
> **Note:** A company moving from a surface site to its Under-deeps site does not need to make a roll. As an exception to this, a Balrog company moving between the Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold and the The Drowning-deeps (or between the Iron Hill Dwarf-hold and the The Rusted-deeps) must roll the number given on the Under-deeps site, which is normally 13 and impossible to roll.

{: .note }
> **Note:** Movement between an Under-deeps site and its surface site is not affected by modifications that affect movement _between_ adjacent Under-deeps sites. Modifications to movement _to_ adjacent Under-deeps sites do apply.

{: .note }
> **Example:** A Balrog company that starts at Carn Dum can move normally or it can move to The Irondeeps—The Iron-deeps lists Carn Dum as an adjacent site. Similarly, a minion company that starts at The Iron-deeps may attempt to move to any adjacent site listed: Carn Dum (0), The Under-leas (6), or The Under-vaults (7). However, after committing to movement, the moving player must roll a 6 or better to successfully move to The Under-leas or a 7 or better to successfully move to The Under-vaults.

{: .note }
> **Example:** A company is moving from The Undergrottos to Goblin-gate with _Long Winter_ in play. _Long Winter's_ effect of returning a company to the site of origin has no effect, since it depends on the company's site path, and the company has no site path. _Long Winter's_ effect of tapping a site will work, since that effect depends on the site's site path, which still exists. Finally, creatures can only be played keyed to the Shadow-hold of Goblin-gate.

# THE SHADOW-DEEPS<br>PLAY TIPS

This deck features the Balrog's Great Shadow form—which is his stealthiest and most reclusive—along with bold adventuring in Sauron's domains. The Under-deeps beneath the Dark Lord's holds tempt the Balrog with the lingering power of Morgoth, the creator and Black Enemy. The Balrog dispatches his Orcs and Trolls to retrieve what they can here and from the strongholds above. The deck's hazards center on Spiders and Animals and the horrible Spawn of Morgoth, newly unearthed for this expansion.

#### Starting Company at Moria

 - Azog controls two Mountain-maggots, Buthrakaur controls the Orc Veteran. Instead of two minor items, start with _Orders from the Great Demon_ on the company and _Gangways over the Fire_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Black Mace_ (x2)—Cirith Gorgor, Minas Morgul, Barad-dur, or Remains of Thangorodrim (after tapping otherwise)

_Cave Troll_—(tapped) The Sulfur-deeps, The lron deeps, The Under-courts, or The Under-galleries

_Descent through Fire_—The Under-courts or The Under-galleries

_Evil Things Lingering_—The Under-courts, Remains of Thangorodrim, or The Under-galleries

_Great Troll_—The Under-grottos, The Iron-deeps, The Under-vaults, The Under-leas, The Sulfur-deeps, or The Drowning-deeps

_High Helm_—any major item Under-deeps site (after tapping otherwise), Cirith Ungol, Carn Dum, or Barad-dur

_Iron Shield of Old_ (x2)—(after tapping otherwise) The Under-grottos, The Under-vaults, The Under-leas, The Drowning-deeps, or Remains of Thangorodrim

_Maker's Map_—Dol Guldur, Remains of Thangorodrim, or The Under-galleries

_Orcs of Mirkwood_—Sarn Goriwing

_Orcs of Moria_—Moria

_Sable Shield_—any major item Under-deeps site (after tapping otherwise), Cirith Ungol, Carn Dum, or Barad-dur

_Stinker_—Goblin-gate

_Tempest of Fire_—Dead Marshes

_Breach the Hold_ (sideboard)—The Drowning-deeps 

_Roots of the Earth_ (sideboard)—The Drowning-deeps

#### Resource Play

The power of this deck improves dramatically using _Great Shadow's_ ability to recycle non-short-event resources and characters. Guiltlessly discard inconvenient MP sources drawn early in the game, because you can recycle and redraw them later. Access additional resources from the sideboard by tapping The Balrog to bring five to your discard pile, cycling these using _Great Shadow's_ ability. Cycle and recycle _Skies of Fire_ to foil an opponent's _Doors of Night_ strategy. 

The deck relies on one or more high prowess non-Balrog companies to roam the heart of Mordor and beyond. There are plenty of cards in the deck to make your characters colossal fighters. _I'll Report You_ (x2), _Black Mace_ (x2), and _Descent Through Fire_ are the main ones, so take special care to play these.

The only underground route to The Under-galleries and The Under-courts—the two most important sites—goes through The Sulfur-deeps. Therefore, avoid tapping The Sulfur-deeps until playing _Descent Through Fire_ and tapping both later sites. Also, avoid tapping The Under-leas and The Under-vaults too early.

#### The Balrog

As soon as convenient, tap The Balrog to bring to the discard pile _Breach the Hold_, _Roots of the Earth_, _Memories of Old Torture_, _Flame of Udun_, and a sideboard resource that reacts to your opponent. These cards are now ready to easily pop into the play deck using _Great Shadow's_ ability, and without taxing play.

In _Great Shadow_ form The Balrog should always be accompanied by his minions outside of a Darkhaven. While waiting to draw _Great Troll_ and _Descent Through Fire_, he should stay in Moria, conveniently bringing in characters and playing _Ancient Secrets_. When the _Orcs of Moria_ faction shows up, snag it for 3 MPs.

Once The Balrog plays _Descent Through Fire_—the deck's most important card—bring in _Breach the Hold_ and _Roots of the Earth_ from the sideboard. Send the Balrog north to The Drowning-deeps/Remains of Thangorodrim area once you draw one of them. Most MP sources are playable between these two sites. Expect to have an excess of MP sources in hand as the game wears on if you have been recycling discarded ones. Consider _Flame of Udun_ to maximize the Balrog's battle-readiness, though this minimizes playing additional MP cards.

Eventually, _Out He Sprang_ will hit the table, allowing The Balrog to surface for company vs. company combat against a hero opponent. To optimally prepare for attacking, bring in _Flame of Udun_, as The Balrog cannot move on the surface with _Great Shadow_.

#### Hazard Play

The hazard mix contains plenty of Spiders, a handful of Animals, and enhancers for both. A few basic utility cards are included to cover blind spots. Certain enhancers—called Spawn—form a natural sub-theme of their own. Three of the deck's hazards depend on the number of Spawn in play. Take special care with the Spawn _Monstrosity of Diverse Shape_. It provides an ability of which you will no doubt make efficient use. However, it also creates a vicious automatic-attack at The Drowning-deeps and Remains ofThangorodrim. You must be prepared to either discard this hazard yourself, cancel its attack, or sacrifice some scrub Orcs to its horribly twisted mass.

# BALROG'S HOST PLAY TIPS

The Balrog uses his Strangling Coils form in this deck to maximize direct influence and faction recruiting. He wants all Orc factions of the Misty Mountains in his Great Army. When the time is right, the Balrog burrows into the Iron Hill Dwarf-hold from the Under-deeps to claim the realm as his own-much as he took Khazad-dum, now called Moria. The hazards contain a mix of two sub-themes: Dragons/Drakes and roadblock.

#### Starting Company in Moria

 - Umagaur controls Bolg, Old Troll starts under general influence. In stead of two minor items, start with _Orders from the Great Demon_ on the company and _Gangways over the Fire_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_A Few Recruits_—Gondmaeglom (tapped)

_Breach the Hold_—The Rusted-deeps

_Goblins of Goblin-gate_—Goblin-gate

_Grey Mountain Goblins_—Gondmaeglom

_Iron Shield of Old_—(after tapping otherwise) The Under-leas or any non-Darkhaven Under-deeps Ruins & Lairs

_Nasty Slimy Thing_—The Gem-deeps, The Pukeldeeps, The Under-vaults or The Under-grottos

_Orcs of Angmar_—Mount Gram

_Orcs of Gu11dabad_—Mount Gundabad

_Orcs of Moria_—Moria

_People Diminished_—Eagle's Eyrie, Beom's House, Thranduil's Halls, or Wellinghall

_Roots of the Earth_—The Rusted-deeps

_Stabbing Tongue of Fire_—(after tapping otherwise) any non-Darkhaven Under-deeps site

_Whip of Many Thongs_—(after tapping otherwise) any non-Darkhaven Under-deeps site

_Eddy in Fate's Tide_ (sideboard)—Wellinghall, Eagle's Eyrie, Thranduil's Halls, Beorn's House

_Invade Their Domain_ (sideboard)—Iron Hill Dwarf-hold

_Lord and Usurper_ (sideboard)—Iron Hill Dwarf-hold

#### Resource Play

You must recruit at least four of the five unique OrC factions to receive two marshalling points from Great Army of the North. Therefore, do not discard unique Orc factions without attempting to influence them. On the other hand, A Few Recruits is an excellent discard choice, unless you have Grey Mountain Goblins in hand or in play and Gondmaeglom is available.

This deck contains two Out He Sprangs to help The Balrog reach an opponent's company for company vs. company combat. If you have a site where an opponent's company is present, attack them if at all convenient. It may be worth holding Great Fissure in your hand indefinitely as insurance waiting for the chance. Bring in Flame of Udun and Scourge of Fire from the sideboard if your opponent travels a lot around the Misty Mountains. Against a minion opponent, bring in Prone to Violence as soon as possible.

The deck's resources threaten your opponent as much as your hazards. Specifically, you have the potential to strip out MPs. Besides the potential of company vs. company combat, you have People Diminished, Crowned with Storm, Eddy in Fate 's Tide, Invade Their Domain, Mine or No One's, and Scourge of Fire, which is probably the most powerful.

Ultimately, you want to complete this expansion's ultimate quest-invading the Iron Hill Dwarf-hold. Leisurely play Roots of the Earth and Breach the Hold as your draw them. They do not have to be played in order, and each keeps The Rusted-deeps in play without committing a character garrison. After you have cycled about half your deck, bring in Invade Their Domain and Lord and Usurper. Keep a couple tactical cards in hand to insure their successful play.

The only underground route to The Rusted-deeps goes through The Under-leas and The Wind-deeps. Therefore, avoid tapping these two sites at least until The Balrog is at The Rusted-deeps and prepared to play In vade Their Domain.

#### The Balrog

The Balrog with Strangling Coils recruits factions very well without enhancement-and usually requires no tactical cards to remain untapped against creatures. When he is not attacking an opponent, The Balrog is your number one option for gathering the Great Army. You will need The Balrog to tap to bring a few cards in from the sideboard. Do not forget to bring in Sudden Call before the first deck cycle ends.

#### Hazard Play

The hazards feature several Dragon Ahunt manifestations, powerful Drakes, Long Winter to tap your opponent's deep Wilde rness sites, and Doors of Night to make everything function efficiently. This deck's hazards slam oppone nts travelling around the Misty Mountains and Dragon country. Unfortunately the hazards are rather weak against Gondor decks, and only mediocre against Mordor and Under-deeps minion decks. Bring in Covetous Th oughts as soon as possible

Use An Unexpected Outposts to recycle Twilights, Long Winters, Doors of Night, and itself as you determine their necessity against each opponent. You need to consider your own movement when playing Long Winter because it taps your deep Wilderness sites too. You need to consider your own movement when playing the Dragon Ahunt cards as your surface movement may take you through hunting grounds against a minion opponent.
