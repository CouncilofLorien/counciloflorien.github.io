# ORIGINAL RULEBOOKS

Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) published the rules for playing the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_) across various set and expansion rulebooks. A Rulesbook or rules insert was published along with each set and expansion of _MECCG_. Additional rules and annotations to the rules were published in the _Companion_ books. 

These original rules are the _official_ rules in that they were authored or authorized by Coleman Charlton and Mike Reynolds, the Designers and Developers of _Middle-earth CCG_ at Iron Crown Enterprises. However, some of these rules are _outdated_ as they were revised, clarified, or superceded over the course of the game. ICE never published a complete and final ruleset as they were developing a second edition of _MECCG_ instead (titled "Lord of the Rings Expandable Card Game" (LoRE), which was never released as ICE lost their license to produce Middle-earth games. The digital version of these original rulebooks do _not_ include errata, clarifications, or revisions but they do correct minor typographical, grammatical, and formatting issues. The Complete & Final Rules present the rules with all errata, clarifications, and other revisions.
