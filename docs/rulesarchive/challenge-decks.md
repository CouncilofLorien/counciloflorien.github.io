## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the _MECCG Challenge Decks_. This box contains everything you need, except for a pair of dice, to challenge any opponent to a fun and competitive match of the _Middle-earth Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_).

This deck is preconstructed with cards available from the following sets of _MECCG_: _Middle-earth: The Wizards_, _Middle-earth: The Dragons_, _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_, _Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye_, _Middle-earth: Against the Shadow_, and _Middle-earth: The White Hand_. Also, some promotional cards printed through _The White Hand_ were used. The cards were all originally printed as common or uncommon except for 3 rares per deck. The cards were chosen to complement each other in order to achieve maximum success in play, yet be rewarding as the story of the deck unfolds. _Challenge Deck_ cards reflect published card errata and clarifications.

The deck is tournament-ready for the two-deck game. This is the game format presented in the Rules Summary. It observes the following Council of Lorien tournament rules: (a) 12-creature minimum; (b) 30-card resource/hazard minimum; (c) up to three Wizards/Ringwraiths allowed in the play deck; (d) Ringwraith players having +5 general influence that cannot control characters; and (e) Ringwraiths and their starting companies beginning play at Minas Morgul or Dol Guldur. If your Wizard or Ringwraith is eliminated, you do not lose the game, but rather lose five marshalling points off your final total and continue playing. 

The Council of Lorien is the sanctioning body of official _MECCG_ tournament play in the United States and Canada. For more information on the Council and coordinating a sanctioned _MECCG_ tournament, contact ICE Promotions at 1 (800) 325-0479.

The deck has 30 resources and 30 hazards, a complete complement of characters and sites for carrying out the resource strategy, and a 20 card sideboard. As per the tournament rules update in _The White Hand_, the sideboard is allowed to contain up to 30 cards. You should consider adding 10 cards to the sideboard when using this deck in a two-deck tournament, as this is certainly legal and adds to your deck's ability to react to an opponent. 

After becoming familiar with your challenge deck, you may want to modify it. You can bring in more powerful cards, or you may want to vary its predictability for playing against familiar opponents. You may want to make the deck even more competitive in a two-deck tournament. For example, the following hazards can benefit almost any _Challenge Deck_: _Mouth of Sauron_, _Uvatha the Horseman_, _Adunaphel_, _Daelomin at Home_, _My Precious_, _Lure of Power_, and _Durin's Bane_. Ringwraith players should consider if Dragon Factions would fit into their existing resource mix. There are 9 Dragon factions all told, each worth from 3 to 6 faction marshalling points. Some excellent resources any Wizard deck can integrate are: the ally _Tom Bombadil_, the faction _Woses of Old Pukel-land_, and the item _The Mithril-coat_.

# • PART I •<br>BEFORE YOU PLAY

This rules summary assumes you are playing the 2-deck game with the standard rules. When this summary, or a hazard card, refers to a Haven/Darkhaven, read it as Haven if you are playing a Wizard and Darkhaven if you are playing a Ringwraith.

## 1 • OVERVIEW

In _MECCG_ you play one of the Wizards or Ringwraiths, trying to influence The Free Peoples or Sauron into letting you lead their armies.

You control one or more companies, which are groups of characters. These companies move around Middle-earth from site to site. At the sites they can gain resources, which provide you with marshalling points (MPs). The MPs for a card are in the upper left-hand corner of the card. The accumulation of marshalling points is the primary way of winning the game.

During the game you may "reveal" yourself. To do this you play a Ringwraith or Wizard card. That card represents you in the game. If that card is eliminated, through combat or corruption, then you lose the game.

While your opponent is moving, you get to play hazards on his companies. These hazards represent the creatures and events your opponent must deal with while traveling in Middle-earth.

## 2 • VICTORY CONDITIONS

The game ends when one of the following occurs during play:

 1. If your Wizard or Ringwraith is "eliminated." In this case your opponent automatically wins. As an exception in tournament play, the game continues. However, the player whose Wizard or Ringwraith is eliminated loses five MPs off his final total, and cannot reveal a new Wizard or Ringwraith.
 2. A Wizard player calls the Free Council. The Free Council may be called either:
      - When each play deck has been exhausted twice, the council starts at the end of the current turn.
      - After you have exhausted your play deck for the second time, you may choose to call the council. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn. This gives your opponent one last turn to catch up to you.
      - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose to call the council if you have accumulated at least 25 marshalling points. The council starts at the end of your opponent's next turn.
 3. A Ringwraith player calls the Audience with Sauron. The audience may be called either:
      - When each play deck has been exhausted twice, the audience starts at the end of the current turn.
      - After you have exhausted your play deck twice you may choose to play _Sudden Call_ as a resource. If you do so, the audience starts at the end of your opponent's next turn.
      - After you have exhausted your play deck for the first time, you may choose to play _Sudden Call_ as a resource, if you have at least 25 marshalling points. If you do so, the audience starts at the end of your opponent's next turn.
      - After your opponent has exhausted his deck twice you may play _Sudden Call_ as a hazard. If you do so, the audience is called after your next turn.
      - After your opponent has exhausted his play deck once, if he has at least 25 marshalling points, you may play _Sudden Call_ as a hazard. If you do so, the audience is called after your next turn.

If your opponent has no marshalling points in a category (besides kill and miscellaneous), you may double your points in that category. No more than half of your positive MPs may come from one category.

## 3 • THE DIFFERENT CARDS

There are four different types of cards in _MECCG_: sites, characters, hazards and resources. Images of the various card types are shown on the color inserts in the center of the book.

Site cards have a map image on the card back, and a white or gray parchment background. The site type is indicated by a symbol in the upper left-hand corner of the card. A key to these symbols is on the back of this booklet. Havens for Wizard players, and Darkhavens for Ringwraith players, are special sites with a star icon in the upper left corner.

Character cards have a blue background for Wizard decks, and a rusted purplish iron background for Ringwraith decks. Characters in Wizard decks are called heroes, and characters in Ringwraith decks are called minions.

Hazards have a dark gray metal background. These cards represent obstacles that your companies will face.

Resources have a copper background in Wizard decks, and a grey-blue steel background in Ringwraith decks. These cards are your main source of MPs, and they help you overcome hazards.

## 4 • GETTING READY TO PLAY

Before you play the game, you must separate your cards into the appropriate decks. You also need a pair of six sided dice.

First, take all of the site cards (with the map card back) and set them aside as your location deck. Then check the Play Tips (p. 27) to see what cards belong in your starting company. Put your starting company in front of you, with the site card Rivendell (for a Wizard deck) from your location deck or Minas Morgul or Dol Guldur (for a Ringwraith deck). Set your sideboard off to the side for the moment. These are the 20 cards with the white letter of the deck on a black circle.

Shuffle together all of the remaining cards. These cards are your play deck. Let your opponent cut your deck, and draw eight cards for your starting hand.

Once both players have separated their decks, shuffled their play decks, and drawn their opening hand, each player should roll two dice. The player with the higher roll must go first.

During the course of play, certain cards will be eliminated, particularly characters. These cards are removed from active play and placed in an _out-of-play pile_. Certain cards you play for MPs will be placed in a _marshalling point pile_.

# • PART II •<br>TURN SEQUENCE

Player's alternate taking turns, following the sequence outlined below. You may play resources any time during your turn, unless card text states otherwise. You may play hazards only during your opponent's movement/hazard phase. If both players wish to play cards at the same time, see p. 25.

## 1 • UNTAP PHASE

During play, you will have to tap cards, usually to indicate that they have been used this turn. To tap a card, rotate it 90°, so that it is sideways on the table. 

During combat (p. 14) characters may become wounded. To wound a character, rotate his card 180°, so that it is upside down on the table.

Perform the following steps, in this order:
 
 1. Untap your tapped character cards.
 2. Heal any wounded characters you have at a Haven/Darkhaven. These characters move from wounded to tapped.
 3. Untap your non-character, non-site cards. Sites do not untap.

## 2 • ORGANIZATION PHASE

Your organization phase is when you assign your characters into companies, and plan your movement for the next turn. During your organization phase, you may perform the following steps in any order:

- Bring a new character into play at a Haven/Darkhaven or their home site, **or** reveal your Wizard or Ringwraith. A Wizard may be revealed at Rivendell or his home site. A Ringwraith may be revealed at Minas Morgul, Dol Guldur, or his home site.
- Reorganize your characters and companies, including changing followers and company composition.
- Transfer and store items.
- Play a new site card for each company that you want to move.

{: .note }
> **Note:** All company composition changes, including organizing companies and bringing characters into play, must all be done at the same time during the organization phase. No other actions may be taken while you are making company composition changes.

### BRINGING A CHARACTER INTO PLAY

To bring a character into play you must have enough influence to control him. Each player has a pool of 20 general influence with which to control characters. Each point of general influence can be used to control one point of mind. A character's mind is shown in the white head symbol on the left side of the character card. A character with eight mind would use eight points of general influence. 

Some characters also have direct influence, shown in the black hand under their mind. Characters may use direct influence to control other characters. Characters must be fully controlled by either general influence or one character's direct influence. A character controlled by direct influence is called a follower. Followers may not control other characters.

Each deck has a Wizard or Ringwraith in it. You may play this character without using influence to control him, as the card represents you in the game. Once your Wizard or Ringwraith is in play, you may not play other characters unless either your Wizard/Ringwraith is at the site where you play the character, or you bring the character into play with direct influence. If playing a Ringwraith, see p. 23.

### REORGANIZING COMPANIES

Characters are organized into companies, and each company moves together as a unit. A company's _size_ is equal to the number of characters in it. When calculating company size, Hobbits and Orc scouts count as half a character (round up). A company's _hazard limit_ is equal to two or the company's size, whichever is greater. The hazard limit is the number of hazards that may be played on a company each turn, and is set at the end of the organization phase.

Any time two of your companies move to the same non-Haven/non-Darkhaven site, they will combine. Any company may split into multiple companies during the organization phase. However, if they are not at a Haven/Darkhaven, then only one company may stay at the site, and all other companies must try to move to different sites that turn.

### TRANSFERRING/STORING ITEMS

During the organization phase, you may transfer items from one character to another character. Both characters must be in the same company, and the character with the item must make a corruption check (p. 22). If the character does not fail the corruption check, the item may be moved to another character.

An item may also be stored at a Haven/Darkhaven. The character must still make a corruption check, and if he does not fail, then the item is placed in your marshalling point pile. Stored items may not be retrieved.

Some resource events may also be stored, as indicated in their card text. No corruption check is required, unless otherwise specified on the card.

### PLAYING A NEW SITE CARD

You must choose where each company is moving during the organization phase, by placing a new site card with each company. A company does not have to move. If you want to move a company, place the new site card representing their destination face down next to the site card representing their current site. You may look through your location deck and pick this card, you do not have to draw it randomly.

If you wish to move a company to a site that is face down on the table, tell your opponent which site the company is moving to. If you wish to move a company to a site that is face up on the table (because another company is also moving there[^faceup]), tell your opponent the company is moving to a face up site.

The new site you choose must meet certain criteria. You may reach a site by either starter movement, or by region movement. Ringwraiths may not use region movement.

#### Starter Movement

If you are at a Haven/Darkhaven, the new site may be a site that lists your current site as its nearest Haven/Darkhaven. The new site may also be another Haven/Darkhaven that lists a site path to your current Haven/Darkhaven.

If you are not at a Haven/Darkhaven, the new site must be the nearest Haven/Darkhaven as listed on the site card.

#### Region Movement

If you are using region movement, the new site must be within four regions of the current site. This includes the regions containing the new site and the current site, as listed on the site cards. In the middle of these rules is a color map showing the regions of Middle-earth, showing which regions are adjacent to each other. A series of regions connects two sites if:

 - The first region contains the current site, and
 - The second region is adjacent to the first region on the map (two regions are adjacent if they are separated by one red line edge), and
 - The third region is adjacent to the second region, and
 - The fourth region is adjacent to the third region, and contains the new site.
 - If the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd region contains the new site, do not worry about the other regions. Only consider regions containing the sites, and any intervening regions.

#### Site Paths

A _site path_ is the sequence of regions between a site and its nearest Haven/Darkhaven. Each region in the sequence is indicated by its type, not by its name. For starter movement a company's site path is listed on the left side of the non-Haven/non-Darkhaven card they are moving to or from, or in the text box of the Haven/Darkhaven if moving between Havens/Darkhavens. For region movement, a company's site path is determined by the regions moved through.

Site paths are mostly used to determine if an opponent can play a particular creature on a company. Some hazards refer to the site's site path, which is always the one listed on the site card. Havens/Darkhavens have no site path.

## 3 · LONG-EVENT PHASE

During this phase do the following in this order:
 
 1. Discard all of your resource long-events.
 2. Discard all of your opponent's hazard long-events.
 3. If you have any resource long-events in your hand, you may play them at this time.

Resource long-events may only be played during this phase. You play hazard long-events during your opponent's movement/hazard phase.

## 4 • MOVEMENT/HAZARD PHASE

The movement/hazard phase is when your companies move from site to site, and is also when your opponent has a chance to play hazards on your companies. Each of you companies has a movement/hazard phase, even if it does not move. You choose the order to resolve your companies' movement/hazard phases. For each company, follow these steps in order:

 1. If the company has a face down site card, turn it over. This is your company's _new site_, and their current site becomes their _site of origin_. If there is no new site, no cards are drawn. If the new site is a Haven/Darkhaven, each player _may_ draw the number of cards indicated on the site of origin. Otherwise, each player _may_ draw the number of cards indicated on the new site. Each player must draw at least one card.
 2. Your opponent plays hazards on the company (see below). A number of hazards equal to the company's hazard limit (p. 9) may be played. Hazards may not be played that target another company, or an entity associated with another company. If a hazard requires the company to return to its site of origin, return the new site card to the location deck (discard it if tapped) and proceed to step 4 (the site of origin becomes its current site). No additional hazards may be played on a company once it returns to its site of origin.
 3. Remove the company's site of origin. Discard the site card if it is tapped and not a Haven/Darkhaven. Otherwise, return it to the location deck.
 4. You must discard any cards in excess of eight in your hand; your opponent does the same for his hand. If you have fewer than eight cards, you must draw cards until your hand has eight cards; your opponent does the same for his hand.

Once all of your companies have resolved their movement/hazard phases, any two of your companies at the same site combine[^combining]. Your companies are now considered to be at their new site (that is, the new site becomes its current site).

### PLAYING HAZARDS

When your opponent moves his companies, you may play hazards on them. Hazard events may be played on any company, unless otherwise specified on the card. The creature hazards you can play depend on how the company is moving.

Creature hazards must be keyed to a company's site path or site. This means you must match one of the symbols along the left side of the creature to one of the symbols in the company's site path, or the symbol representing their site type. You only have to match two of the symbols if a symbol is repeated on the creature card. In this case there must be two of that particular symbol in the company's site path in order to key that creature to that symbol. Matching symbols like this is called keying a creature by type. Some creatures may be "played in" certain regions by name, or sites in those regions. Matching names like this is called keying a creature by name.

If the company is not moving, you may only key creatures to their current site, by name or type.

If the company is moving, you may key creatures to their new site, by name or type. You may key creatures by type to the regions of their site path. If the company is using starter movement, you may key creatures by name to the regions containing the site of origin and the new site. If the company is using region movement, you may key creatures by name to any regions the company passes through.

#### Placing Cards On-Guard

During your opponent's movement/hazard phase, you may place one card _on-guard_ for each of your opponent's companies. This card is placed face down next to the company's new site (current site if they did not move). Any card can be placed on-guard, even a resource, but placing a card on-guard counts against the hazard limit.

The card will remain on the site until either:

 - _The company decides to face the site's automatic-attack_. If the on-guard card is a hazard creature keyed to the site **or** a hazard that can modify the automatic attack, then it may be revealed before the automatic attack is resolved. Revealed hazard creatures attack after the automatic-attack.
 - _The company plays a card that potentially would tap an untapped site_. If the on-guard card is a non-creature hazard, it may be revealed if it is a hazard that affects the company or a character in the company that site phase.
 - _The site phase ends_. Return the card to your hand. 
 
If the card is revealed, treat it as if it had been played during the movement/hazard phase. This means whatever it is played on must have existed during the movement/hazard phase.

An on-guard card cannot be revealed that:

 - returns a company to its site of origin;
 - taps a company's site;
 - potentially removes a character from a company, other than through combat or corruption;
 - Forces a company to do nothing during the site phase; or
 - directly taps a character.

### COMBAT

Combat consists of one or more _attacks_ that must be resolved one at a time. An attack consists of one or more _strikes_. Characters and attacks have prowess (the number before the slash in the lower left of the card), which is used to determine the outcome of strikes. 

Strikes are assigned in the following manner:

 1. The defending player may assign one strike each to any untapped characters he wants.
 2. The attacking player may assign strikes to any characters that are not already assigned strikes.
 3. If the attack has more strikes than there are characters in the company, each character is assigned one strike, and the excess strikes are assigned as -1 modifications to the prowesses of whichever characters the attacker chooses.

Once the strikes are assigned, the defending player resolves the strikes in any order he chooses.

#### Resolving Strikes

For each strike, follow the sequence below:

 1. The attacker may play hazard cards that affect the strike. These count toward the hazard limit.
 2. The attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications from extra strikes.
 3. If an untapped character is facing the strike, he must tap **or** take a -3 modification to prowess. An already tapped character gets -1 to prowess, and a wounded character gets -2 to prowess.
 4. An untapped defending character that is not himself the target of a strike may tap to give + 1 to the prowess of a defending character.
 5. The defending player may play resource cards that affect the strike, but only one that requires skill. 

Next, the defender makes a roll, and adds his modified prowess:
 
 - If the result is greater than the strike's prowess, the strike _fails_. Such a strike is defeated if it fails a body check (see below).
 - If the result is equal to the strike's prowess, the strike was _ineffectual_. Nothing happens.
 - Otherwise, the strike was _successful_. The target character is wounded and must make a body check. If the attack was detainment (p. 16), the character is tapped, not wounded, and makes no body check.

#### Body Checks

If a non-detainment strike against a character is successful, the character must make a _body check_. To make a body check, the **attacker** makes a roll; if this value is greater than the character's body, he is eliminated. 

If a non-detainment strike fails against a character, it is automatically defeated if its body is "–" **or** if the **defender** makes a roll and the result is higher than the attack's body.

#### Detainment Attacks

Detainment attacks tap rather than wound characters. An attack is considered detainment in the following situations:

 - If it states the attack is detainment on the card.
 - All Nazgul attacks against minion companies.
 - Any attack keyed, against a minion company, to a Dark-domain, Shadow-hold, or Dark-hold.
 - Any Orc, Troll, Undead, or Man attack keyed to Shadow-land.[^detainment]

The above parameters apply even if the attack is keyed to a region or site by name which has the appropriate type.

#### Defeating an Attack

An attack by a hazard creature is defeated if it is not detainment, **and** all of its strikes are defeated (strikes assigned as -1 modifiers need not be defeated). When a hazard creature is defeated, the card is placed in the defender's MP pile.

If a hazard creature has multiple attacks, each **must** be defeated in order for the defender to receive MPs. 

If one of the strikes was canceled or ineffectual, the attack is **not** defeated. If the attack was canceled, it is **not** defeated.

A Ringwraith player may only receive MPs from creatures with an \* next to the MPs. A Wizard player may only receive MPs from creatures without an \* next to the MPs.

If an Orc or Troll character faces a strike from an attack from an opponent's card that was defeated, you may place the creature's card under his control as a _trophy_. Trophies are considered minor items with zero corruption points. Trophies may not be transferred or stored. Discarded trophies that are worth marshalling points to you are placed in your marshalling point pile, otherwise, they are placed in your opponent's out-of-play pile.

Trophies give the following bonuses based on the MP value printed on the card, with or without an \*:

 - 1 MP worth of trophies gives + 1 direct influence.
 - 2 MPs worth of trophies gives +1 direct influence and + 1 prowess (to a maximum of 9)
 - 3 MPs worth of trophies gives +2 direct influence and + 1 prowess (to a maximum of 9)
 - 4+ MPs worth of trophies gives +2 direct influence and +2 prowess (to a maximum of 9)

## 5 • SITE PHASE

Each of your companies has a site phase, and you may resolve them in any order you wish. In order to do **anything** during the site phase, you must first enter the site and then face any and all automatic-attacks listed on the site card (a character at his home site may tap to cancel one automatic-attack at his home site). See Combat, p. 14.

Once you have entered the site, you may:

 - Play an item, faction, ally, or any resource playable at the site. Items, factions, and allies can only be played at an untapped site unless specifically allowed at a tapped sites on their card.
 - Influence your opponent's resources at the site.
 - Attack your opponent's company at the site.

### PLAYING AN ITEM

To play an item, the item must either state it is playable at the site, or the site must state that items of that type are playable at the site. You may tap an untapped character in a company at an untapped site and place the item with that character. This taps the site.

### PLAYING AN ALLY

Playing an ally is similar to an item. Tap an untapped character at an untapped site and place the ally with the character. This taps the site. Allies do not count as characters, except for combat and playing skill cards. They do not count for company size.

### PLAYING A FACTION

To play a faction, tap one character in the company to make an influence attempt. Roll the dice, add the character's unused direct influence, any standard modifications for the character's race (heroes) or other factions in play (minions), and any other modifications from other cards. If the result is higher than the number listed on the faction, put the faction in your MP pile, and tap the site. The site does not tap otherwise.

### PLAYING MINOR ITEMS

After playing a resource that taps the site, you may tap another character in the company to play a minor item. This may be done even if minor items are not normally playable at the site.

### INFLUENCING AN OPPONENT'S RESOURCES

If you are at the same site as an opponent's resource or character, you may tap a character and attempt to influence his card. If successful, the resource or character is discarded. You may reveal an identical card and play it.

You may make one influence attempt against your opponent per turn, you may not make one on the first turn, and your Wizard or Ringwraith may not make one on the turn he is revealed. You may not make an influence attempt against your opponent:

 - If you have declared company vs. company combat this turn;
 - Against his Ringwraith or Wizard;
 - Against an item, ally, or follower controlled by his Ringwraith or Wizard.

#### Influencing Characters

To attempt to influence a character, make a roll and:

 - Add the influencing character's unused direct influence.
 - Subtract your opponent's unused general influence.
 - If the target character is a follower, subtract his controlling character's unused direct influence.
 - Subtract the result of a roll by your opponent.
 - Add any other modifications from special abilities and cards played before the roll.
 - If you are a Ringwraith and your opponent is a Wizard, or vice versa, subtract five.

If the modified result is greater than the target's mind, the target character and all of his non-follower cards are discarded.

If you reveal an identical character card from your hand before making the roll, the targets mind is treated as if it were zero. If the attempt is unsuccessful, you must discard the character card you revealed. If the attempt is successful, in addition to discarding the target, you may immediately play your card at that site, regardless of his home site. You must have enough influence to control the character in order to play him.

#### Influencing a Faction

To influence a faction, you must be at the site where the faction is playable. Make an influence check as for a character, except:

 - Instead of mind, the result must be greater than the number normally required to play the faction.
 - Apply any relevant standard modifications.
 - Revealing an identical faction reduces the number to bring the faction into play to zero, and allows you to play that faction if the attempt is successful.

#### Influencing an Ally

To influence an ally, make an influence attempt as for a character, except:

 - Use the ally's mind instead of the character's.
 - Subtract the unused direct influence of the character controlling the ally.
 - Revealing an identical ally card reduces the ally's mind to zero and allows you to immediately play the ally with the influencing character if the influence check is successful.

#### Influencing an Item

To influence an opponent's item, make an influence attempt as for a character, except:

 - The mind of the controlling character is used.
 - Subtract the unused direct influence of the item's controlling character.
 - You _must_ reveal an identical item card in order to make an influence attempt. If the influence attempt is successful, you may play your card with the influencing character.

### COMPANY VS. COMPANY COMBAT

If you are at the same site as an opponent's company, and have not made an influence attempt against him this turn, you may engage that company in company vs. company combat. This attack is declared and enacted following all other actions your company takes during the site phase. Company vs. company combat must be Ringwraith vs. Wizard or vice versa.

Company vs. company combat is treated like an attack with a number of strikes equal to the number of characters in the attacking company. Each strike has a prowess equal to the attacking character corresponding to the strike.

#### Cards that Affect Company vs. Company Combat

Either player may play resources that affect the combat. However, only the defender may play cards that affect the attack as a whole. Hazards may not be played, and have no effect during company vs. company combat.

The attack may be canceled like an ordinary attack. However, cards that cancel attacks from specific race types only work if each character in the attacking company has one of the races listed on the card.

#### Assigning Strikes

For company vs. company combat, assign strikes as follows:

 1. The defender chooses which of his _untapped_ characters will be the targets of given strikes.
 2. The attacker choose which other defending characters not yet assigned a strike will be the target of any remaining unassigned strikes corresponding to his _untapped_ characters.
 3. The defender assigns any remaining strikes to his characters that have not been assigned strikes.

If there are more strikes than defending characters, the attacker may assign excess strikes as -1 modifiers to prowess, during the strike sequence outlined below.

#### The Strike Sequence

Strikes are resolved one at a time in the order chosen by the defending player. For each strike, follow the sequence below:
 
 1. The attacking player may play resource cards that affect the strike (up to one card that requires skill).
 2. The attacker may decide to use any or all of his remaining -1 modifications from extra strikes.
 3. An attacking untapped character may take a -3 modification to prowess so that he will not automatically tap. An already tapped character gets -1 to prowess, and a wounded character gets -2 to prowess.
 4. A defending untapped character may take a -3 modification so that he will not automatically tap. An already tapped character gets -1 to prowess, and a wounded character gets -2 to prowess.
 5. An untapped defending character that is not himself the target of a strike may tap to give +1 to the prowess of a defending character.
 6. The defending player may play resource cards that affect the strike (up to one card that requires skill).

Next, the attacker makes a roll and adds his modified prowess to get the strikes _final prowess_.

Then, the defender makes a roll and adds his modified prowess:

 - If this result is greater than the strike's final prowess, the strike _fails_. The character corresponding to the strike is wounded and must make a body check (p. 15).
 - If this result is equal to the strike's final prowess. the strike was _ineffectual_. Nothing happens.
 - Otherwise, the strike was _successful_. The target character is wounded and must make a body check.

If a character is defeated in company vs. company combat, the opposing player receives kill marshalling points as indicated on the character's card.

(End-of-Turn Phase)[^endofturn]

# • PART III •<br>SPECIAL SITUATIONS

Certain situations occur at multiple points in the turn sequence, and are covered here.

## 1 • CORRUPTION CHECKS

Each character has a corruption point total. This starts at zero, but certain cards will change this total during play. Only one corruption hazard may be played on a given character each turn.

### CORRUPTION CHECKS

When a card or other effect indicates that one of your characters must make a corruption check, you must make a roll and add any appropriate modifications:

**Nothing Happens**—If the modified result is greater than the character's corruption point total, nothing happens.

**The Character is Discarded or Tapped**—If the modified result is equal to the character's corruption point total **or** one less than the total, a hero character _fails_ the corruption check and you must discard him along with any non-follower cards he controls. If the character is a minion, he is not considered to have failed the check, and is tapped if not already tapped.

**The Character is Eliminated**—If the modified result is less than the character's corruption point total by two or more, the character _fails_ the corruption check and is eliminated. Discard any non-follower cards he controls.

If a Wizard fails a corruption check, he is immediately eliminated. Ringwraiths never make corruption checks.

## 2 • RINGWRAITHS

Ringwraiths have many special effects, which are summarized below:

 - A Ringwraith may only be in a company with non-Ringwraith characters if he is at a Darkhaven.[^ringwraithfollowers]
 - Any ring in the Ringwraith's company at the beginning of the end-of-turn phase is automatically tested. Any test in a Ringwraith's company has a modification of -2.
 - A Ringwraith may carry items, but such items have no effect.
 - Ringwraiths never make corruption checks, and corruption hazards may not be played on Ringwraiths.
 - A Ringwraith may not use a site path that contains Coastal Sea regions.
 - A Ringwraith's company may not use region movement.[^modecard]
 - If a body check against a Ringwraith is exactly equal to 7 or 8, then Ringwraith is returned to your hand. You do not lose the game if your Ringwraith is removed in this fashion—you may bring such a Ringwraith back into play the same way you revealed him.

## 3 • RING ITEMS

Ring special items are more complicated to play than normal items. First, you must play a gold ring item at an appropriate site. Then you must have a card or effect that _tests_ the gold ring. When you test a gold ring, make a roll. On the gold ring item will be a list of results, and what ring special items you can play. If you have one of the indicated special ring items in your hand, you may replace the gold ring item with the special ring item. In any case, discard the gold ring item when it is tested.

## 4 • SIDEBOARDS

Your sideboard allows you to make minor modifications to your deck during play.

#### Using Your Sideboard When You Exhaust Your Deck

Whenever you exhaust your play deck, you may exchange (before reshuffling) up to 5 cards between your sideboard and discard pile. Each card taken from your sideboard must be replaced by a card from your discard pile.

#### Using Your Sideboard When You Tap Your Ringwraith or Wizard

During you organization phase, you may tap your Ringwraith or Wizard to bring up to 5 resources and/or character cards from your sideboard into your discard pile.

Alternatively, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may tap your Ringwraith or Wizard to bring one resource or character card from your sideboard into your play deck (reshuffle).

#### Using Your Sideboard When Your Opponent's Wizard or Ringwraith is in Play

At the end of your opponent's untap phase, if your opponent's Ringwraith or Wizard is in play, you may at this point bring up to five hazard cards from your sideboard to your discard pile; **or**, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may bring one hazard card from your sideboard into your play deck (reshuffle). 

If you move cards from your sideboard in this fashion, the hazard limit for each of your opponent's companies is reduced to half of normal for the rest of the turn (round up).

## 5 • TIMING

You and your opponent may both want to perform actions at the same time or actions that are sequenced with respect to other actions. Such actions often include playing a card, tapping a character already in play, and revealing an on-guard card.

Your opponent may always declare an action in response before your action is resolved. You may respond to each other's actions until neither player can, or wants to, perform an action.

You must give your opponent a chance to respond to every action, and vice versa. If you perform an action and move on to another action without giving your opponent a chance to respond, you must "back-up" if he wants to respond.

A series of declared actions is called a chain of effects. You always have the option of declaring the first action in a chain of effects during your turn. The actions in a chain of effects are resolved one at a time from last declared to first declared. That is, the last declared action is resolved first, and the first declared action is resolved last. This is called last in first out, or LIFO, order of resolution.

An action in a chain of effects is negated if the conditions required to perform it are negated by another action that is resolved before it in the chain of effects. 

Creature hazards may not be played in response to other actions. They must always start a chain of effects.

## 6 • UNIQUE, CANNOT BE DUPLICATED, & MANIFESTATIONS

If a card states that it is "unique" or that it "cannot be duplicated," only one such card (or its effects) may be in play at a time. Cards in the marshalling point and out-of-play piles are in play for this purpose. The first card played takes precedence (influence checks may change this). This restriction applies to all cards in play (both yours and your opponent's).

Some cards may not be duplicated on a specific target. Multiple copies of such a card can be in play, so long as each applies to a different target. A card that cannot be duplicated may be played when a copy is already in play only if the copy in play is currently being targeted by an effect that will discard it.

Certain entities have several different _manifestations_, each represented by a different card. If one manifestation of such an entity is in play, you may _not_ play another manifestation of the same entity. If one manifestation of such an entity is in the out-of-play or marshalling point piles, you may not play any further manifestations of that entity.

Certain hero resources and minion resources have the same name. These resources are considered manifestations of each other.

## 7 • EXHAUSTING YOUR PLAY DECK

You exhaust your deck when you draw the final card from it. Discard any cards that are discarded when a deck is exhausted, and make any exchanges with the sideboard (p. 24). Then shuffle your discard pile. This becomes your new play deck. Place all of your discarded sites back into your location deck.

# • PART IV •<br>PLAY TIPS

## INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the Play Tips is to give practical advice and direction for playing your _Challenge Deck_. Most of these decks have a few cards whose successful play depends directly on the play of another card. Often, when just picking up a deck for the first time, these combination dependent cards are not obvious. Please read the Play Tips for your deck to make certain you have as much information as possible to enjoy it to its fullest.

As mentioned in the Rules Summary, a listing of Starting Companies are included in the Play Tips. In official _Challenge Deck_ tournament play, you must start with your designated company—the characters of each have been chosen to not conflict with those of the other _Challenge Decks_. 

A particularly useful section of a deck's Play Tips is _Suggested Sites for Resources_. These have been specially selected to minimize conflicts between available sites. For example, Moria is a greater item site. However, it is the only site where _Book of Mazarbul_ is playable. For the two decks with _Book of Mazarbul_, the _Suggested Sites_ do not list Moria as an option for those decks' greater items. In general, multiple sites are listed for a particular resource, try to use the first one, everything else being equal. Site options listed later tend to also be useful for other resources in the deck. Be aware that certain resources, especially those from the sideboard, can be played during your second deck cycle. When you exhaust your deck, all of your discarded sites becomes available again for the following cycle.

{: .text-center}
## <mecd>A</mecd> – STEWARDS OF GONDOR

{: .text-center .text-delta }
SARUMAN'S CHALLENGE DECK

With Saruman's deck, Glorfindel and a group of Hobbits travel into the civilized confines of Gondor, south of the White Mountains, to rally mannish factions against Sauron's hosts. The deck relies heavily on attack avoidance. The hazards mix is pure Orc/Troll strategy.

#### Starting Company (2)

 - Glorfindel II controls Anborn
 - Fatty, Sam, and Adrazar form the second company.<br>Farry has _Cram_ and Adrazar has _Horn of Arnor_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Glamdring_—Glittering Caves, Isle of the Ulond, Moria, or Tolfalas

_Hauberk of Bright Mail_ (x2)—Glittering Caves, Isle of the Ulond, or Tolfalas.

_Knights of Dol Amroth_—Dol Amroth

_Men of Anfalas_—Lond Galen

_Men of Anorien_—Minas Tirith

_Men of Lebennin_—Pelargir

_Palantir of Orthanc_—Isengard

_Rangers of Ithilien_—Henneth Annun

_Sapling of the White Tree_—Glittering Caves, Isle of the Ulond, Moria,[^sapling] or Tolfalas.

_Scroll of Isildur_—Tolfalas or Moria

_Treebeard_—Wellinghall

_Riders of Rohan_ (sideboard)—Edoras

_The White Tree_ (sideboard)—Minas Tirith

#### Resource Play

As quickly as possible, Adrazar and the Hobbits need find themselves in Gondor so that Adrazar can recruit factions. Stopping at the Glittering Caves along the way to pick up a major item is ideal. Glorfindel and Anborn can pick up other resources as needed.

#### Saruman

During the first free organization phase after bringing Saruman into play, tap him to bring _Vanishment_, _Wizard's Laughter_, and _Wizard Uncloaked_ from the sideboard to the discard pile. He can then tap to take one of these spells to your hand as needed.

Consider bringing Saruman into play at Isengard. This allows him to play the _Palantir of Orthanc_, and to use it, without moving. When using the Palantir, Saruman needs other characters in his company to support his corruption checks. You may consider moving Saruman to Wellinghall—as it is safer—if he wishes to use the Palantir every turn.

In general, Saruman has plenty of tasks that require him to tap. If you lose key characters and need Saruman's presence in the field, give the Palantir to another character and bring _Align Palantir_ in from the sideboard. A Hobbit is always a good choice to use an aligned Palantir.

#### Hazard Play

A major aspect of an Orc/Troll strategy is forcing so many combat rolls on your opponent that statistically some strikes are bound to be successful, even if the prowesses seem weak. The creatures in this deck have a high frequency of play, so it is usually a safe gambit to build them up in your hand waiting for a _Minions Stir_ or _Two or Three Tribes Present_.

#### Sideboard

After playing _Sapling of the White Tree_, tap Saruman to bring in _The White Tree_ from your sideboard. After playing _Palantir of Orthanc_, you probably want _Align Palantir_. On the hazard end of things, your sideboard has the potential of destroying a Wizard opponent's general influence. This makes your opponent vulnerable to _Muster Disperses_ and to your influence attempts against his marshalling point sources. If you recognize early in the game that your opponent is playing many factions, you may want to dedicate _An Unexpected Outpost_ to bringing these hazards into your play deck. Use _An Unexpected Outpost_ to recycle _Minions Stir_ and _Doors of Night_ otherwise.

## <mecd>B</mecd> – RELEASE THE PRISONERS

{: .text-center }
ALATAR'S CHALLENGE DECK

Elrond leads Alatar's companies into the Orc-holds of the mountains surrounding Rivendell. Their errand is to rescue Free People captives and recover stolen items. _Gates of Morning_ and strong warriors see them through. The hazards feature a classic mix of corruption with Undead. 

#### Starting Company

 - Elrond controls Elladan. Erkenbrand controls Orophin. Elrond has _Cram_ and Erkenbrand has _Shield of Iron-bound Ash_. If you have multiple site-tapping resources for your initial draw, consider starting them as 2 companies: Elrond and Elladan, Erkenbrand and Orophin.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Book of Mazarbul_—Moria \[storing it at the Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold]

_Goldberry_—Old Forest

_Gollum_—Goblin-gate

_Orcrist_—Carn Dum or Mount Gundabad

_Rangers of the North_—Bree

_Rescue Prisoners_ (x3)—tapped Carn Dum, Mount Gram, Goblin-gate, Moria, or Mount Gundabad.

_Scroll of Isildur_—Carn Dum or Mount Gundabad

_Sword of Gondolin_—Barrow-downs or Zarak Dum

_The Windlord Found Me_—Mount Gram

_Blue Mountain Dwarves_ (sideboard)—Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold

_Great-shield of Rohan_ (sideboard)—Zarak Dum or Barrow-downs

#### Resource Play

Alatar's deck makes active use of _Gates of Morning_. Its most powerful tactic is to cancel and discard the final hazard played against a company with _Many Turns and Doublings_ if _Gates of Morning_ is in play. _Gates of Morning_ provides a natural defense against some of the more powerful hazards that require or benefit from _Doors of Night_.

A patient player can elegantly rise to the threat of most hazards. Take the time to move Elrond to Rivendell to play _Vilya_. Store a _Rescue Prisoners_ as soon as you can to get its character untapped. Do not forget that you can do this at Bree, Old Forest, and the Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold in addition to at a Haven. You will face strong creatures in the mountains, but always consider tapping your characters to face strikes and waiting another turn to play that resource. You should receive many kill marshalling points.

#### Alatar

Alatar works well being active and traveling with his characters. If his company is at a Haven, move it last to give him the option of "teleporting" to another company facing an attack. He has enough direct influence alone to bring any faction into play, but look to give him followers to free general influence in your defense. This deck is vulnerable to _Muster Disperses_.

#### Hazard Play

Play corruption cards as soon as you can. As an exception, consider playing _Lure of Expedience_ on-guard if you feel fairly certain a company will play an item. Then reveal it and place it on the character playing the item. He must make a dangerous corruption check.

The undead are fairly effortless to play. You can increase the threat of the corruption cards by playing _Corpse-candle_ and then _Barrow-wight_ on corruption-laden companies. Hold off playing _Chill Douser_ until you can follow it up with another Undead. If an opponent is moving to a site with an Undead automatic-attack, _Chill Douser_ during the movement/hazard phase should make him think twice about entering the site. Consider this with _The Moon is Dead_ in play. Amassing bonuses to Undead prowesses and strikes during a turn gives its own rewards.

#### Sideboard

After playing the _Book of Mazarbul_, tap Alatar to bring in the _Blue Mountain Dwarves_. Try to both store the item and recruit the faction with one trip to the Dwarf-hold. Of course, storing this item before the Free Council begins is the most important thing.

## <mecd>C</mecd> – DWARVEN QUEST

{: .text-center }
PALLANDO'S CHALLENGE DECK

With the prompting of Pallando, Thorin II leads a company of Dwarves into the Dragon lairs and Shadow-lands east of the Misty Mountains in a quest for their people. The Dwarves operate with a good mix of fighting enhancement and attack avoidance. The hazards are Animals and Wolves.

#### Starting Company

 - Thorin controls Kili and Dori. Gloin controls Oin.<br>Thorin and Oin have the _Crams_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Bow of Dragon-horn_—Ovir Hollow or with _Bounty of the Hoard_.

_Book of Mazarbul_—Moria \[storing it at the Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold]

_Durin's Axe_—Sarn Goriwing or Buhr Widu

_Enruned Shield_—Caves of Ulund or The Lonely Mountain

_Gollum_—Goblin-gate

_Hauberk of Bright Mail_—Sarn Goriwing or Buhr Widu

_Iron Hill Dwarves_—Iron Hill Dwarf-hold

_Magical Harp_—Ovir Hollow or with _Bounty of the Hoard_.

_Men of Dorwinion_—Shrel-Kain

_Quickbeam_—Wellinghall

_Wormsbane_—Dead Marshes, Caves of Ulund, or The Lonely Mountain

_Blue Mountain Dwarves_ (sideboard)—Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold

#### Resource Play

This deck is loaded with items giving strong tactical advantages in play. Corruption is a natural danger when playing a large number of items, so take the time to play both _Fellowships_.

In a deck using one large company, resources that allow multiple marshalling point sources to be played in one turn are needed for speed. This deck has three: _Bounty of the Hoard_, _Lucky Search_, and _Thror's Map_. Take special care to use these to their full advantage. _Thror's Map_ is the most powerful of the bunch so never discard it. Note that _Lucky Search_ can only be played at Dead Marshes, Goblin-gate, Moria, or Sarn Goriwing—not at a Dragon's Lair.

This deck can fight creatures for marshalling points or cancel the overwhelming threats. After the first few risky turns, the Dwarven company should be in a comfortable position when attacked.

#### Pallando

Pallando should move to Lorien and form a company there from the play deck. This company is responsible for playing the two allies and the _Book of Mazarbul_—if not played with the Dwarves on an early turn. Otherwise, Pallando should not move unless you can properly protect him with tactical options from your hand. After playing _Quickbeam_, relocate Pallando's company to Rivendell. Tap Pallando to bring the _Blue Mountain Dwarves_ into the play deck. His company should be in a convenient position to move to the Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold to store the _Book of Mazarbul_ and play this faction.

#### Hazard Play

The hazards attempt to swarm an opponent with high frequency of play creatures. Do not underestimate the role of _Neeker-breekers_. The greatest threats are the spiders and _Watchers in the Water_ enhanced with _Full of Froth and Rage_ and _Wake of War_. The hazards also have a roadblock subtheme that fills out its blind spots in the dark areas against Ringwraith opponents.

#### Sideboard

The sideboard for this deck is not as important as with other Challenge Decks. The most important play is bringing in the _Blue Mountain Dwarves_ after playing the _Book of Mazarbul_. If you believe your opponent has any sort of Dragon or Drake creatures, bring in _The Old Thrush_. 

{: .text-center }
## <mecd>D</mecd> – BARGAIN BETWEEN FRIENDS

{: .text-center }
RADAGASTS'S CHALLENGE DECK

Along with Beorn, Gimli and Legolas, an unlikely duo of Dwarf and Elf, carry out missions of diplomacy in the hostile territories north of Mordor. Potent combat abilities with some subtle attack avoidance characterizes these heroes of Radagast. The hazards feature ranks of roguish Men.

#### Starting Companies (2)

 - Beorn, Gimli, and Legolas form one company. Beorn has _Black Arrow_ and Legolas has _Cram_.
 - Halbarad starts by himself and should stay in Rivendell.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Beornings_—Beorn's House

_Bow of the Galadhrim_—Buhr Widu, Raider-hold, or Gobel Mirlond

_Easterlings_—Easterling Camp

_Iron Hill Dwarves_—Iron Hill Dwarf-hold

_Men of Dorwinion_—Shrel-Kain

_Noble Hound_ (x2)—tapped Easterling Camp, Dale, Gobel Mirlond, Raider-hold, or Shrel-Kain

_Noble Steed_ (x3)—tapped Buhr Widu, Easterling Camp, Dale, Gobel Mirlond, Raider-hold, or Shrel-Kain

_Orcrist_—Dead Marshes or Moria

_Torque of Hues_—Buhr Widu, Raider-hold, or Gobel Mirlond

_Wood-elves_—Thranduil's Halls

_Great-shield of Rohan_ (sideboard)—Buhr Widu, Raider-hold, or Gobel Mirlond

_Men of Dale_ (sideboard)—Dale

_Wain-easterlings_ (sideboard)—Easterling Camp (during the 2nd deck cycle)

#### Resource Play

The diplomat skill rises to the forefront in Radagast's deck. You should only begrudgingly discard _New Friendships_. This card helps with corruption checks, influence attempts, and _Flatter a Foe_, which can devastate a well planned turn of hazards.

Try to play _Forewarned is Forearmed_ only in response to the play of a creature or automatic-attacks it affects. You do not want an opponent to have an easy shot at killing your _Assassin_.

#### Radagast

Radagast must play an active role for this deck to succeed. He certainly should move through Wilderness to draw extra cards, but do not feel you should maximize the Wildernesses in his site path or draw all the cards he has coming. You can always draw cards one at a time and determine the potential of each before choosing to burden your hand with more. If Radagast does not keep the card drawing in check, you will draw more marshalling point sources than you can play in one turn. This forces you to discard hazards or resource tactical options while you wait to play the marshalling points. If you discard the marshalling points instead, you may not be able to accumulate enough when later turns arrive.

Radagast's direct influence should be used to control characters as soon as possible in order to free general influence. Until this happens, the deck is vulnerable to _Muster Disperses_ and influence attempts by an opponent. The fact that he and a follower or two form a second company allows you to play more resources from your hand. His special ability then allows you to draw the next round of marshalling points—or a good complement of hazards—more regularly.

#### Hazard Play

This deck has what possibly is the best creature in the game, _Assassin_. If the option is available, use _Thrice Outnumbered_ to recycle _Assassin_ (unless you know your opponent is not going near its keyable sites).

#### Sideboard

Against a corruption strategy, tap Radagast to bring in _Glamour of Surpassing Excellence_ as soon as possible. This card is more effective against corruption than meets the eye.

The Dragon Ahunt cards offer a nice opportunity against opponents who travel consistently in their affected regions, so quickly bring these in once you recognize you are playing the right opponent.

## <mecd>E</mecd> – RETURN OF THE KING

{: .text-center }
GANDALF'S CHALLENGE DECK

Gandalf sends Aragorn and Arwen into the lands along the Anduin River to find lost icons of Gondor. Their efforts also take the pair to Minas Tirith to be crowned King and Queen. The deck relies primarily on attack avoidance. The hazards contain a heavy mix of good general creatures.

#### Starting Companies (2)

 - Aragorn controls Arwen. Arwen starts with _Star-glass_.
 - Faramir controls Annalena. Faramir starts with _Elf-stone_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Beautiful Gold Ring_ (x3)—Bandit Lair, Gladden Fields, Isengard, or Moria

_Glamdring_—Haudh-in-Gwanur, Buhr Widu, Moria, or Isengard

_Hauberk of Bright Mail_—Haudh-in-Gwanur, Buhr Widu, Moria, or Isengard

_Narsil_—Dead Marshes

_Noble Steed_ (x2)—tapped Buhr Widu, Haudh-in-Gwanur, or Edoras

_Quickbeam_—Wellinghall

_Rangers of Ithilien_—Henneth Annun

_Return of the King_—Minas Tirith

_Sword of Gondolin_—Haudh-in-Gwanur, Buhr Widu, Moria, or Isengard

_Tower Guard of Minas Tirith_—Minas Tirith

_Knights of Dol Amroth_ (sideboard)—Dol Amroth

_Riders of Rohan_ (sideboard)—Edoras

#### Resource Play

Untapped scouts can play a crucial part in the success of Gandalf's deck. They provide your main means of attack avoidance by using _Concealments_ and _Stealths_. There are enough weapons in your deck to make Aragorn and a couple of other warriors from the play deck into formidable fighters, so expect to receive a few marshalling points from creature kills.

Ultimately, you want to give Arwen a _Lesser Ring_. This provides her with enough direct influence to control Aragorn. These two form a powerful 2-character company who require only 3 general influence. With _Return of the King_ on Aragorn, he can recruit any faction in the deck virtually automatically. If you play _Tower Guard of Minas Tirith_ before _Return of the King_, be sure to leave a character at Minas Tirith so that the site is still available to play _Return of the King_. _Return of the King_ does not require the site to tap, nor is its play limited to the site phase.

#### Gandalf

One of Gandalf's primary tasks is testing the 3 _Beautiful Gold Rings_ with his special ability. This means Gandalf must be untapped and must have joined the company bearing the ring. It should not strain your hand too much to hold the _Magic Ring of Stealth_ and _Lesser Rings_ waiting for the gold rings and Gandalf's test. Otherwise, in a company with other characters, Gandalf should feel free to move around gathering resources.

#### Hazard Play

The hazards offer a wide variety of creatures with good attacks in a complete range of regions and sites. Except for _Searching Eye_, each hazard is playable on its own, without directly benefiting from another. This means the hazards do not require you to hold cards in hand waiting for an optimal complementary hazard before playing them. If you must discard and have a creature in hand you are not certain you can play soon, discard it and do not look back. The resource strategy needs all the tactical supporting cards it can get, so freely sacrifice hazards to make room.

#### Sideboard

Tap Gandalf to bring in the 2 factions after playing _Return of the King_. Otherwise the resources in the sideboard offer general options to defend against specific opponents. This quality of generality holds even more for the sideboard hazards.

ADUNAPHEL'S CHALLENGE DECK

Adunaphel sends traitorous bands bent upon thievery and espionage into the untainted domains of the Free Peoples. Her inherent knowledge of these areas provides some cover, but her missions are extremely difficult to carry out. The hazards feature a potent offering of Drakes.

#### Starting Companies (2) at Dol Guldur

 - Ciryaher controls Ostisen. Ostisen starts with _Foul-smelling Paste_.
 - Asternak, Dogrib, Mionid, and Luitprand form another company.<br>Asternak controls Dogrib and starts with _Blazon of the Eye_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_The Least of Gold Rings_ (x2)—Bandit Lair, Beorn's House, Edoras, Moria, of Thranduil's Halls

_Red Book of Westmarch_—Bag End \[storing it at Barad-dur]

_Secrets of their Forging_ (x2)—Dimrill Dale, The Worthy Hills, Eagles' Eyrie, or Thranduil's Halls

_Stinker_—Goblin-gate

_That's Been Heard Before Tonight_ (x2)—Eagles' Eyrie, Thranduil's Halls, or Bag End

_To Satisfy the Questioner_ (x2)—Eagles' Eyrie, Beorn's House, Edoras, or Thranduil's Halls

_Woses of the Eryn Vorn_—The Worthy Hills

_Goblins of Goblin-gate_ (sideboard)—Goblin-gate (2nd deck cycle)

_Orcs of Moria_ (sideboard)—Moria

_Regiment of Black Crows_ (sideboard)—The Worthy Hills, Dimrill Dale, or Bandit Lair

#### Resource Play

Adunaphel's deck has many resources that need one or more extra turns of preparation before awarding marshalling points. This makes the deck slow and requires holding cards in hand for along time. What is more, unlucky dice rolling can devastate this deck. The only consolation is that your marshalling point sources are generous, and that successfully playing this deck can be very rewarding. Amassing marshalling points from characters is key, so consider seriously the play of sources of extra influence.

It is not necessary to play both Dwarven Rings. In fact, they appear in duplicate to ease the plight of playing one. Make a reasonable effort to play both, but not at the expense of attack avoidance or easier marshalling points sources. Give the first Dwarven Ring to Asternak. He should try to influence the Wose faction with either the Dwarven Ring or _Join with that Power_.

Note that _Deeper Shadow_ cancels and discards the second hazard against a moving 2-character company containing Ciryaher.

#### Adunaphel

Adunaphel's role is simple. She sits in Dol Guldur and cancels one attack a turn. However, you have many attack avoidance cards. During organization phases where you have 3 or more such cards in hand (including _Deeper Shadow_), she should tap to bring a resource in from the sideboard. Evaluate your opponent's hazards or your own marshalling point needs to make this choice. Recognizing when you do not need her attack cancellation is critical to this deck's success.

#### Hazard Play

To complement your difficult resource strategy is a deadly mix of Drake hazards. Key to successfully using them is knowing both what and how to recycle with _From the Pits of Angband_. Sending a drake back to your hand with _Doors of Night_ is not always best, especially with a resource strategy requiring a lot of cards in hand. Do not hesitate to place a drake with _Summons from Long Sleep_ to get it out of your hand. You do sacrifice its surprise value this way, but you also may cause an opponent to overestimate the threat against him and adjust his movement accordingly.

#### Sideboard

During your opponent's first untap phase when you have few hazards in hand, half his hazard limit. Then bring _Itangast Ahunt_, _Sand-drake_, and _True Cold-drake_ to your discard pile. These cards will be available options when _From the Pits of Angband_ hits the table.

## <mecd>G</mecd> – MARAUDING BROOD OF UGLIES

{: .text-center }
DWAR'S CHALLENGE DECK

Dwar's deck sends the Lieutenant of Morgul and a detachment of orc warriors to Dragon country and to burn a couple Border-holds down. Dwar has unwavering faith in the philosophy of might, and seeks large factions of Orcs to serve his needs. The hazards use _Doors of Night_ to unleash packs of Wolves.

#### Starting Company at Dol Guldur

 - Lieutenant of Morgul, Muzgash, Lagduf, Radbug, and Tros Hesnef form the starting company. The Lieutenant controls Muzgash and Lagduf. Lagduf and Radbug each start with _Foul-smelling Paste_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_The Arkenstone_—The Lonely Mountain, Moria, Caves of Ulund, Dancing Spire, Gold Hill, or Irerock.

_Black Mace_ (x3)—The Lonely Mountain, Moria, Caves of Ulund, Dancing Spire, Gold Hill, or Irerock.

_Burning Rick, Cot, and Tree_ (x2)—tapped Raider-hold or Dale

_Gleaming Gold Ring_—Dale

_Grey Mountain Goblins_—Gondmaeglom

_High Helm_—Raider-hold

_Ice-orcs_—Caves of Ulund, Dancing Spire, Gold Hill, or Irerock.

_Orcs of Gundabad_—Mount Gundabad

_Regiment of Black Crows_ (x2)—tapped Caves of Ulund, Dancing Spire, Gold Hill, Gondmaeglom, Irerock, or The Lonely Mountain.

_Orcs of Moria_ (sideboard)—Moria (during second deck cycle)

_Regiment of Black Crows_ (sideboard)—tapped Caves of Ulund, Irerock, Dancing Spire, Gold Hill, Gondmaeglom, or The Lonely Mountain.

_Sable Shield_ (sideboard)—The Lonely Mountain, Caves of Ulund, Dancing Spire, Gold Hill, or Irerock

#### Resource Play

Dwar's deck is primed for a couple delights only Ringwraith players enjoy: trophies and the Troll trio of Burat, Tuma, and Wuluag. If at all possible, place prophies with the Lieutenant of Morgul. In fact, take any opportunity to increase his direct influence. He has multiple uses for it, such as _I'll Report You_, controlling followers, and recruiting factions. Particularly, you want to maximize the chance of successfully recruiting the _Ice-orcs_. Shagrat has almost the same potential as the Lieutenant in all these respects.

Sacrifice almost any other card to keep members of the Troll trio in hand until playable. In a company together, their benefits are remarkable for the influence they require. The trio in tandem effectively have only a -1 penalty to prowess when not tapping to face a strike. Consider this scenario. Burat and Tuma each face a strike from an attack. Burat does first and taps—with his prowess, the strike likely fails. Tuma face his strike next, but first taps to untap Burat. Tuma has -1 prowess against the strike for being tapped, but Burat has become untaps.

For the 2 Border-holds there are 2 site-tapping resources: _Gleaming Gold Ring_ and _High Helm_. In order to play the 2 _Burning Rick, Cot, and Trees_, you must use these resources at their designated Border-holds and not leave the sites before burning them down. It is well worth it to discard a few hazards to keep components of the Border-hold combination in hand.

#### Dwar

Dwar does not move from Dol Guldur. During the earlier turns, he should tap to give the combat bonuses to his fledgling companies. On later turns, when the prowess of these characters increase, Dwar can freely tap to bring resources in from the sideboard. Do not forget to bring in _Sudden Call_ during the first deck cycle.

#### Hazard Play

Nothing tricky here. Wolves and animals do not hit as hard as other creatures, but they have a high frequency of play.

#### Sideboard

Use Dwar to bring the _Minor Ring_ to the discard pile at his first safe opportunity. It is then available when _Gleaming Gold Ring_ is brought to him for testing. _Orders from Lugburz_ is good for getting the Lieutenant and Shagrat into one monster company.

Against a Wizard opponent, consider bringing the _Rebel-talks_ in from the sideboard and recycling _Stay Her Appetite_. You may remove all of your opponent's allies in this way and double the marshalling points from your allies.

## <mecd>H</mecd> – STEALTHY TRIBE

{: .text-center }
HOARMURATH'S CHALLENGE DECK

Hoarmurath directs a band of Morgul scouts into the fringe Shadow areas of the Misty Mountains to steal technologies and win over independent Orc tribes. His minions rely on stealth and minimal movement in the open, though they can fight in a pinch. The hazards are solid Undead. 

#### Starting Companies (2) at Dol Guldur

 - Gorbag, Grishnakh, Ufthak, and Lugdush form the main company.<br> Gorbag controls Grishnakh and starts with _Blazon of the Eye_. Ufthak starts with _Strange Rations_.
 - Ill-favoured Fellow starts by himself at Dol Guldur and waits for more characters to join his company.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_The Arkenstone_—Moria or Caves of Ulund

_Blasting Fire_ (x3)—tapped Shadow-hold

_Great Lord of Goblin-gate_—Goblin-gate

_High Helm_—Mount Gundabad or Sarn Goriwing

_Orcs of Moria_—Moria

_Sable Shield_—Mount Gundabad or Sarn Goriwing

_Scroll of Isildur_—Moria or Caves of Ulund \[storing it at Barad-dur]

_Snaga-hai_ (x2)—tapped Shadow-hold

_Stinker_—Goblin-gate

_Vile Fumes_ (x3)—tapped Shadow-hold

_War-wolf_ (x3)—tapped Shadow-hold (except Dead Marshes and Mount Gram)

_Black Mace_ (x2) (sideboard)—Moria or Caves of Ulund (2nd deck cycle)

_Orcs of Mirkwood_ (sideboard)—Sarn Goriwing


#### Resource Play

The trickiest aspect of this deck is playing multiple site-tapping resources at a small number of Shadow-holds. The 3 _Records Undead_ are key to pulling this off. This minor item untaps Goblin-gate for the 2 allies playable there and Moria for its faction and one greater item. The nature of this deck is for the company of Orc scouts to move very little, thereby decreasing the number of creatures that attack them. Once a Shadow-hold is tapped, the deck provides a great number of playable 1 marshalling point resources including factions, allies, and items. A company should not move to an untapped Moria or Goblin-gate unless it has one of the resources specific to that site in hand.

#### Hoarmurath

Hoarmurath taps every organization phase to bring a resource to the play deck from the sideboard. The only exception is when you have _Voices of Malice_ in your hand—Hoarmurath is your only sage. He does not move from Dol Guldur in any case, increasing your hand size by one. It may be useful to bring in _Fell Rider_ near the end of the first deck cycle. In this way, you have the option of moving Hoarmurath for the second cycle.

#### Hazard Play

Woe be the opponent who wanders into this hazard mix unprepared! Practicing a little patience, you can unload a vicious mix of Undead attacks. The key is to turn them into monsters with bonuses from _The Moon is Dead_, _Plague of Wights_, and _Chill Dousers_. For example, you can reasonably create a _Ghouls_ attack of 14 strikes at 10 prowess. You should generally look to discard hazards in favor of keeping your numerous marshalling point sources in hand, however.

#### Sideboard

Many resources in the sideboard will undoubtedly be useful against any opponent: _Orc Quarrels_, _Black Maces_, _Sudden Call_, etc. In fact, with Hoarmurath tapping most turns to bring a resource into the play deck, you effectively increase the number of resources in the play deck without increasing the number of hazards.

There is nothing tricky about the sideboard hazards. Use _An Unexpected Outpost_ to recycle your best Undead creatures or enhancers if you are making good use of them. Otherwise bring in hazards from the sideboard to hit the elusive opponent in new ways.

## <mecd>I</mecd> – MORGUL RALLYING CRY

{: .text-center }
THE WITCH-KING'S CHALLENGE DECK

The Witch-king's mission is to solidify Sauron's forces in Mordor. His minions do best when not moving from the safety of this evil domain. They have very little to help them tactically, but in Mordor they should not need much. The hazards can create a devastating environment of roadblock.

#### Starting Companies (3) at Minas Morgul

 - One Orc Captain controls Ill-favoured Fellow. This company travels to Mount Doom to sit for most of the game.
 - Horseman in the Night controls Orc Veteran. Horseman in the Night starts with _Blazon of the Eye_. This company travels to Nurniag Camp to sit for most of the game. 
 - The other Orc Captain and Orc Brawler form the third company. This Orc Captain starts with _Blazon of the Eye_, and the company travels to Cirith Gorgor to sit for most of the game.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_Asdriags_—Nurniag Camp

_Blasting Fire_ (x3)—tapped Shadow-hold or Dark-hold

_Great Bats_ (x3)—tapped Shadow-hold

_Helm of Fear_—Barad-dur

_Nurniags_—Nurniag Camp

_Orcs of the Ash Mountains_—Cirith Gorgor

_Orcs of Udun_—Cirith Gorgor

_Palantir of Minas Tirith_—Minas Tirith

_That Ain't No Secret_ (x3)—Mount Doom

_Uruk Hai_—Cirith Gorgor

_Vile Fumes_ (x3)—tapped Shadow-hold or Dark-hold

_Black Trolls_ (sideboard)—Cirith Gorgor

_Last Child of Ungoliant_ (sideboard)—Shelob's Lair

#### Resource Play

Play the _Awaiting the Calls_ on the 2 Orc Captains to free enough general influence to bring in more characters. This means you should play _That Ain't No Secret_ on the Ill-favoured Fellow since the Orc Captain at Mount Doom ideally should not move to store this event. The lesser mind characters will "shuttle" between sites, storing resources, delivering _Records Unread_ to Nurniag Camp, etc. Note that the lower mind characters from the deck can come into play under direct influence at the Dark-holds.

#### The Witch-king

The Witch-king moves with _Fell Rider_ to Minas Tirith to play the Palantir, and to Barad-dur to play _Helm of Fear_. Playing these items requires him to tap twice. Otherwise, the Witch-king, as the deck's only sage, should be untapped to play _Voices of Malice_ to discard _Foolish Words_ or other debilitating hazard permanent-events. _Foolish Words_ can be revealed as an on-guard card in response to an attempt to play a faction. During the site phase, with _Voice of Malice_ in hand, the Witch-king should wait for all faction attempts before himself playing an item. He can always wait another turn to play his item.

#### Hazard Play

This deck has an unusual hazard strategy that often causes great frustration for an opponent—the "Roadblock Strategy." Its goal is to prevent an opponent from reaching his new site or to tap his new site prematurely to prevent the play of resources. An opponent who recognizes this strategy should forget all other sideboarding needs and bring in his anti-roadblock resources. These include _Gates of Morning_, _Skies of Fire_, _Promptings of Wisdom_, and _Piercing All Shadows_. As for your play, the key is your _An Unexpected Outposts_. You must choose your cards to recycle from _Long Winters_, _Snowstorm_, _Doors of Night_, another _An Unexpected Outpost_, and _Twilight_.

#### Sideboard

If _Voices of Malice_ is not in hand, or if you will not try to influence a faction, tap the Witch-king to bring in a resource from the sideboard. _Above the Abyss_ against a Wizard opponent is invaluable. When a company of 3 or more Orcs forms at Minas Morgul, bring in _Last Child of Ungoliant_. You should play her near the end of the first deck cycle. Of course, you will need _Sudden Call_ towards the end of the first cycle. Hazard-wise, bringing in _Foul Fumes_ against certain Wizard opponents can be important.

## <mecd>J</mecd> – SECUDING NATIONS OF MEN

{: .text-center }
INDUR'S CHALLENGE DECK

Indur enlists The Mouth to seduce nations of mannish factions in the less civilized lands surrounding Mordor. Adept in the dark arts of magic, Indur sends along a master of sorcery, Hador, to protect these efforts. The hazards feature corruption with a mix of general creatures. 

#### Starting Company at Dol Guldur

 - The Mouth controls Horseman in the Night. Hador controls Odoacer. The Mouth starts with _Strange Rations_ and Horseman in the Night starts with _Blazon of the Eye_.

#### Suggested Sites for Resources

_The Arkenstone_—Caves of Ulund of Moria

_Balchoth_—Raider-hold

_Corsairs of Rhun_—Raider-hold

_Easterlings_—Easterling Camp

_Haradrim_—Southron Oasis

_High Helm_—The Wind Throne

_Palantir of Orthanc_—Isengard

_Scroll of Isildur_—Caves of Ulund or Moria \[storing it at Barad-dur]

_Southrons_—Southron Oasis

_Stinker_—Goblin-gate

_Wain-easterlings_—Easterling Camp

_Great Bats_ (sideboard)—tapped Goblin-gate, Moria, or Mount Gundabad

_Grey Mountain Goblins_ (sideboard)—Gondmaeglom

_Orcs of Gundabad_ (sideboard)—Mount Gundabad

#### Resource Play

Your goal should be to play 5 of the 6 man factions at the 3 Border-holds surrounding Mordor. Essential to playing two at one site is the minor item, _Secret Book_. It may become a chore moving a character to a Border-hold just to untap it with this item, but it is often necessary.

_High Helm_ can help The Mouth or Horseman in the Night with their influence attempts. Pay close attention to the Standard Modifications factions in play give. You may receive more bonuses here than anticipated.

Hador plays a very important part in the success of this deck. He casts a powerful attack avoidance sorcery, _Tormented Earth_. When not needed otherwise, tap another character to help Hador with the corruption check from this spell. Note that Hador can play _Tormented Earth_ even if tapped or wounded. _Slayers_ are a real threat, so save _Ready to His Will_ to make this creature an ally and stop its attacks.

One or more companies of Orcs should form at Dol Guldur. These are responsible for playing most of the non-faction resources. Never hesitate to sacrifice an Orc to a large attack for the greater good of Sauron.

#### Indur

Indur does not move. He uses his special ability to bring discarded _Tormented Earths_ back to your hand quickly. If enough attack avoidance is otherwise in hand, Indur can tap during his organization phase to bring a resource to the play deck. _Poisonous Despair_ works best if taken to the discard pile first. Indur can bring this to your hand if your opponent becomes a threat to influence your marshalling points away.

#### Hazard Play

The hazards have a high frequency of play so that the _Secret Books_ cycle into your hand quickly. The creatures will not consistently threaten your opponent, but your corruption should have a profound effect. A prudent opponent will slow down his movement to take time removing the corruption cards; a careless opponent will take costly losses from failed corruption checks.

#### Sideboard

The sideboard contains an additional 8 marshalling points of resources. They work well coming into the deck for the second deck cycle. If your companies are in good shape tactically, tap Indur to bring some of them in sooner.

ANNOTATIONS

The Rules Archive provides the original published text without modification from errata or official clarifications. However, they do have corrections to minor typographical, grammatical, clerical, and typesetting issues in the original text. Such corrections are not annotated. Anything in the original text that goes beyond a minor issue is left unaltered and described in these annotations.

[^faceup]: The rules on Playing a New Site Card state: "If you wish to move a company to a site that is face down on the table, tell your opponent which site the company is moving to. If you wish to move a company to a site that is face up on the table (_because another company is also moving there_), tell your opponent the company is moving to a face up site." There appears to be a clerical error. A site card that is in play "because another company is also moving there" would be face down, not face up. A site card would be face up when a company is there and it is their current site. So they would not be "moving there." There appears to have been an issue with summarizing the rules for "Moving Companies to the Same Non-Darkhaven Site" from pages 60 and 61 of MELE. In MELE it is clear that player can "state that their new site card is already in play (the current site card for the non-moving company)" when they moving a company to a face up site to _join_ the company already there (not "because another company is also moving there" as in the _Challenge Deck_ Rules Summary).
[^Combining]: This rule was revised for _The Balrog_ Rules Summary: "Once all of your companies have resolved their movement/hazard phases, any two of your companies at the same _non-Haven/non-Darkhaven_ site combine (companies at Havens/Darkhavens may combine if they wish)."
[^detainment]: The rules on Detainment Attacks state: "Any Orc, Troll, Undead, or Man attack keyed to Shadow-land." This only applies to such attacks against _minion_ companies, not hero companies. This statement was revised in _The Balrog_ Rules Summary.
[^endofturn]: The End-of-Turn Phase is missing in the _Challenge Deck_ Rules Summary.
[^ringwraithfollowers]: The rules on Ringwraith Followers is missing in the _Challenge Deck_ Rules Summary.
[^modecard]: The requirement that Ringwraith characters be in a "mode" to move to a non-Darkhaven site is missing in the _Challenge Deck_ Rules Summary.
[^sapling]: The Play Tips for Saruman's deck suggest playing _Sapling of the White Tree_ at Moria but _Sapling_ is "Not playable in a Shadow-hold ![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg) or Dark-hold ![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)" and Moria is a Shadow-hold.
