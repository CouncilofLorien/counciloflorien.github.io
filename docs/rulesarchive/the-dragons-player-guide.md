# MIDDLE-EARTH<br>THE DRAGONS PLAYER GUIDE

## 8 • CARD ERRATA AND CLARIFICATIONS

This is a listing of essential card errata and clarifications through _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_. This list does not reflect errata from the _METW_ Limited printing to the first printing of the Unlimited. You should refer to the Collected Rulings File given on ICE's WEB page at "_http://www.ironcrown.com_" for the complete list in detail. We apologize for not being abble to include a more complete list here, but the limited space prohibits this. You can also send a SASE to Iron Crown Enterprises at ICE, P.O. Box 1605, Charlottesville, VA 22902, USA for a copy of the complete Collected Rulings File. Envelopes must be stamped for 4 ounces. In the U.S.A. this means for at least $1.01 as of 12/96, from overseas this means 2 validated international postal coupons must be enclosed. 

Also note two points of errata to the rules insert from _Middle-earth: Dark Minions_. These rules are correct and should be considered as though they were printed in the rules insert. 1) A tapped agent may take an action to untap (i.e., move from tapped status to untapped status). 2) Under Agents, Playing Creatures at an Agent's Site, replace "If one of your agents and one or your opponent's companies are both at the agent's home site, …" with "If one of your agents is at his home site and one of your opponent's companies is at or moving to that site, …"

_Alatar_ (clarification)—Alatar can use his "teleport" ability if he is wounded, tapped, or untapped. Alatar always faces a strike when he teleports, regardless of his wounded or tapped status. Alatar must teleport (and declare he is facing a strike) before any other strikes are assigned.

_Alatar_ (errata)—Change "…; he must tap and make a corruption check immediately following the attack." to "…; he must make a corruption check immediately following the attack, and, if untapped, he must tap."

_Align Palantir_ (errata)—Add "May not be duplicated on a given Palantir."

_A Short Rest_ (clarification)—This card only allows the extra card draw for moving companies that actually have a site path. If a company moves with _Eagle-mounts_, for example, it does not have a site path and does not trigger _A Short Rest_.

_Assassin_ (clarification)—If an attack from _Assassin_ is given more than one strike, each additional strike becomes an excess strike (-1 prowess modification) against the attacked character. An _Assassin_ can never assign strings to more than one character.

_Balrog of Moria_ (clarification)—The "in addition" section of Balrog of Moria is used if Galadriel is out of play, even if she is eliminated.

_Burglary_ (clarification)—If you fail the roll for the Burglary, you cannot then play an item.

_Cruel Caradhras_ (errata)—Replace "Minas Morgul" with "Imlad Morgul."

_Cruel Caradhras_ (clarification)—The attack does not apply to a company starting at a site in the affected regions.[^caradhras]

_Dragon's Desolation_ (clarification)—Playing _Dragon's Desolation_ to make a Dragon playable at a Ruins & Lairs does not necessarily require you to play a Dragon later in the turn.

_Dragon's Hunger_ (errata)—Replace "Otherwise, the attack is cancelled." with "Otherwise, the attack is cancelled and the opponent must reveal his hand."

_Dwarven Rings_ (all) (clarification)—Give +2 (+7) to direct influence.

_Elven Cloak_ (clarification)—Can cancel a strike keyed to double (or multiple) Wilderness.

_Escape_ (clarification)—Cannot be played on a wounded character.

_Eye of Sauron_ (clarification)—This card can be played and resolved before any Nazgul is palyed with it. A Nazgul must be played as the first declared action in the chain of effects following the resolution of Fell Beast. If a Nazgul is not played immediately following the resolution of this card, this card is returned to its player's hand. This card cannot be played for no effect just to discard it. This card can be played on an existing Nazgul attack, but the extra platability this card provides would not apply.

_Goldberry_ (clarification)—No player may assign strikes to _Goldberry_. She may tap to give a character +1 in combat. _Goldberry_ cannot prevent a company from returning to its site of origin that failed its roll to move to an adjacent Under-deeps site. 

_Gollum_ (clarification)—The text on _Gollum_ is an ability that you can choose to use, not an effect that happens automatically.

_Great Ship_ (errata)—Add "Tap a character in target company during the organization phase to play Great Ship on that company." Replace "…contains a coastal sea region…" with "…contains a coastal sea region and no consecutive non-coastal sea regions…"

_Halfling Strength_ (clarification)—If used to heal a Hobbit when healing effects affect all characters in a company, it will heal all other wounded characters in the company.

_Ioreth_ (errata)—Replace "Healing card" with "Healing effect."

_Ioreth_ (clarification)—Will not duplicate the untap portion of a healing effect on tapped but unwounded characters.

_Khamul the Easterling_ (clarification)—The cards are discarded from opponent's hand.

_Lucky Search_ (errata)—Add at the end of the first paragraph "Discard item if the scout is wounded by this attack."

_Lure of Expedience_ (clarification)—Will trigger when a gold ring item is tested and a special item is successfully played. Will trigger when an item is transferred.

_Lure of Nature_ (errata)—Replace "at the end of each movement/hazard phase" with "after all other hazards have been played."

_Magical Harp_ (clarification)—Can be used at the Council of Lorien.[^council]

_Mallorn_ (errata)—The first sentence could read: "**_Playable at Bag End only if Earth of Galadriel's Orchard is stored there._**"

_Many Foes He Faught_ (clarification)—The penalty is -0/-0 for the first strike, -1/-1 for the second, -2/-2 for the third, and so on.

_Master of Wood, Water, or Hill_ (clarification)—The sage does not have to be in a moving company whose site path is affected.

_More Sense than You_ (clarification)—If there is only one character in the company, this will cancel the attack.

_Morgul-horse_ (clarifications)—To bring a Nazgul permanent-event back into your hand, _Morgul-horse_ must be declared after tapping the Nazgul is declared and before it resolves. Regarding only the alternative effect, this card can be played and resolved before any Nazgul is played with it. A Nazgul must be played as the first declared action in the chain of effects following the resolution of the alternative effect of _Morgul-horse_. If a Nazgul is not played immediately following the resolution of this card, this card is returned to its player's hand. This card cannot be played for no effect just to discard it.

_Mount Doom_ (clarification)—Hazard creatures keyable to Mount Doom can be played regardless of any resources prohibiting their play. Creatures that can be played at Mount Doom by description can always be played at Mount Doom regardless of resources in play (like _Stealth_, _Hiding_, etc.). If the site type of Mount Doom changes, creatures may be keyed to the new site type, but not to the old site type.

_Muster_ (clarification)—Can be played when influencing an opponent's faction.

_Muster Disperses_ (clarification)—Muster Disperses cannot be revealed as an on-guard card.

_Neeker-breekers_ (errata)—"Does not affect Wizards."

_Noble Hound_ (errata)—Add the sentence: "If _Noble Hound_ is tapped or wounded, treat it as though it were untapped for purposes of assigning strikes."

_Old Forest_ (errata)—Replace "healing cards" with "healing effect."

_The Old Thrush_ (errata)—Add "Cannot be duplicated on a given attack."

_The One Ring_ (clarification)—"Starting prowess" refers to the prowess printed on the character card.

_Reforging_ (clarification)—You may only bring back minor and major weapons, minor and major armor, or minor and major shields with _Reforging_. You can use it on hoard items.

_Ren the Unclean_ (clarification)—If you tap _Ren_, then you cannot play resources to aid your character's corruption checks. Your characters may tap in support.

_Rescue Prisoners_ (errata)—This card gives 2 marshalling points, not 3. Add "You receive the marshalling points for this card only when it is stored."

_Rhosgobel_ (errata)—Replace "healing cards" with "healing effects."

_Roac the Raven_ (clarification)—Using this ally to make an influence attempt does not tap a site, and may be done if his company is at a tapped site.

_Sacrifice of Form_ (errata)—Replace "-3 to any body checks" with "+3 to any body checks."

_Sacrifice of Form_ (clarification)—After _Sacrifice of Form_ is played, you may not play a different Wizard and your opponent may not play the Wizard you sacrifices.

_Shadowfax_ (clarification)—Cannot use his special ability if another ally is in the company.

_Slayer_ (clarification)—The target of _Slayer_ can tap to cancel an attack. If an attack from _Slayer_ is given more than one strike, each additional strike becomes an excess strike (-1 prowess modification) against the attacked character. A _Slayer_ can never assign strikes to more than one character.

_Thorin II_ (clarification)—Gets a total of +4 direct influence against the _Blue Mountain Dwarves_.

_Thorough Search_ (errata)—Replace "…to play any item normally found at its current site." with "…to play a minor, major, or gold ring item normally found at its current site."

_Tolfalas_ (errata)—Playable: Items (minor, major, greater\*) \*_Scroll of Isildur_ only.

_Twilight_ (clarification)—Can target a card that has not yet resolved. Can be played as a resource during your opponent's turn. If played this way, it will not count toward the hazard limit. 

_The Under-galleries_ (clarification)—This card provides miscellaneous marshalling points.

_Vilya_ (errata)—Replace "If your play deck has at least 5 cards in it, you may take 5 resource cards." with "If Elrond is in Rivendell and your play deck has at least 5 cards in it, you may take 3 cards."

_Weariness of the Heart_ (clarification)—Only the first paragraph of this card cannot be duplicated. The alternative effect of forcing a character to make a corruption check does not have the cannot be duplicated restriction.

_The Windlord Found Me_ (clarification)—Can be used to recover a Wizard discarded with _Sacrifice of Form_.

[^caradhras]: This ruling was later reversed. It can be played on a company starting in one of the regions. The _Challenge Deck_ printing reflects the later ruling.
[^council]: This was a mistake and the clarification to Magical Harp was later changed from "Council of Lorien" to the "Free Council."
