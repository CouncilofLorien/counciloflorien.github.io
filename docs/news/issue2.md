News from The Council of Lórien, Issue Number Two (10/29/96)

News from The Council of Lórien
vaice@aol.com [attn: Council of Lórien]

As of November 1st, the following policy is in place for official Sanctioned and Qualifier Council tournaments. A Sanctioned Council tournament is an MECCG event that requires advance approval for sanction status and use of the Council package for running the event, awarding Council prizes, and reporting results to ICE to rank the players. Winners of Sanctioned Council Events may qualify to participate in that year's Council of Lórien National tournament. A Qualifier Council tournament is a special type of Sanctioned Council tournament that ICE determines in advance to guarantee the winner(s) participation in that year's Council of Lórien National tournament. ICE reserves the right to award Sanctioned or Qualifier status on MECCG tournaments and will periodically review its award policy. Other MECCG events may receive promo material and prize support, other than that officially reserved for Council of Lórien Sanctioned and Qualifier tournaments, from ICE, but winner(s) will not be ranked, and are not qualified to participate in that years Council of Lórien National tournament.

Each Sanctioned or Qualifier tournament has a tournament coordinator. This is the person in charge of running the tournament. In the text below, "tournament coordinator" means the coordinator or any staff member assigned by the coordinator to assist him or her. Tournament coordinators are responsible for seeing that the council guidelines are kept, prizes are properly awarded, and that that the tournament is run in a fair and impartial manner. Tournament coordinators need to make sure that all results (including the individual score sheets of each player) are returned to the Council of Lórien within two weeks after the tournament so that they can be properly recorded. Failure to report a the results of a Sanctioned or Qualified event may mean that ICE will not Sanction or Qualify future events run by said coordinator.

GENERAL

1) Participation-- Anyone is welcome to participate in a Council of Lórien sanctioned tournament except:
a) I.C.E. employees, their spouses, and their immediate family. Free-lance contractors and artists are eligible to compete.

 

b) Official representatives of Iron Crown Enterprises in an on-going agency status such as on-line and net representatives.

c) Show staff who are working in any capacity at the event where the tournament is run. This status includes people who wish to volunteer time running demos at an I.C.E. booth, sanctioned demo, or sanctioned tournament area. This also includes any staff working a sales booth and anyone receiving a badge from I.C.E.

2) Two Player Games Only--All Council matches will be between two players. Multi-player and solitaire tournaments will not be official Council events without specific approval from the Council of Lórien. Permission for a multi-player event must be obtained prior to the running of the event. To obtain permission, the tournament coordinator must submit a written proposal for the tournament structure he or she proposes to use. All such submissions become the property of Iron Crown Enterprises which may choose to publish them (with credit to the original designer).
3) Accommodations--Players must be provided with reasonably comfortable accommodations. The playing environment must be clean and reasonably free of elements that pose a threat to the physical integrity of each player's cards.
4) Using Maps--If standard rules are being used, an appropriate map of the regions of MECCG can be used to depict region movement (instead of using actual region cards). The text of region cards takes precedence over maps, however. Certain regions, which may appear to be adjacent on a map, in fact, are not listed as adjacent on the appropriate region cards (e.g., Rohan and Dagorlad, Cardolan and Lindon). Such regions are not considered adjacent, even when a map is used for region movement. Maps from the Middle-earth CCG Mapsª were designed to minimize any discrepancies.
5) Character Draft--Starting characters will be determined by draft as per the guidelines printed on page 55 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion.; This method is called the Character Draft (and is detailed below).
 

Character Draft

 

Each Player selects up to 10 characters to put into his or her pool of potential starting characters. This happens before characters are selected for the play deck. Each player reveals his or her first choice for a starting character simultaneously with opponent. If this character is duplicated by opponent's selection, both characters are set aside (this character may not appear in either player's starting company). Each player then selects a second character to reveal (but not a character revealed earlier). Each unduplicated revealed character goes into its player's starting company. Each player continues this process until one of the following occurs: the player has 5 characters in his or her company, the total Mind of that player's starting characters is 20, the player has exhausted his or her pool of 10 potential starting characters, or the player decides to stop revealing characters (i.e., he or she is satisfied with the starting company). Note that when one player stops, the other player continues revealing characters until one of the four conditions is met. A player may not reveal a character that would bring the total Mind of all of his or her starting characters above 20.

In his or her play deck, each player may now assign up to 10 characters, and this may include any unrevealed or duplicated (set aside) characters from his or her pool of starting characters. Note that the Character Draft differs from the rulesbook in that a duplicated starting character does not automatically go into the play deck, and that its inclusion in the play deck does count against the deck's 10 character maximum.

Allowing players to introduce characters in this fashion minimizes matches where each player starts with very few characters because of multiple duplications.

6) Free Council Ties--The Weakest Link Method, as printed on page 57 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion (and detailed below), is used to break Free Council ties.
 

The Weakest Link Method

 

If both players have an equal number of marshalling points after the Free Council has resolved (i.e., there is a tie), add one corruption point to each non-Wizard character in play. Each character (including the Wizard) must make another corruption check. marshalling points are recounted and victory is awarded to the player with the most marshalling points. If there is still a tie, add one more corruption point to each non-Wizard character and each makes another corruption check. Again, assess marshalling points to see if a winner emerges. If not, continue adding one corruption point, making corruption checks, and reassessing marshalling points until a winner emerges.

If, in the unlikely event, all non-Wizard characters in play are corrupted away by this method, and there is still a tie, each player receives 3 tournament points (see description of the Swiss System tournament format below):

Note that the Weakest Link Method simulates who will most likely fail in the final struggle against Sauron. The characters are not actually being corrupted at the Free Council. Instead, the Free Council is "peering; into the heart and soul" of each character and assessing him or her.

7) Simultaneous Elimination--If each player's Wizard is eliminated by the corruption checks made before the Free Council (or on the same round of The Weakest Link Method), there is a tie. Each player receives 3 tournament points (see description of the Swiss System tournament format below).
8) To determine which player's characters make their corruption checks first when going before the Free Council (and possibly carried into The Weakest Link Method), each player makes a dice roll. Rerolling ties, the player who rolls highest chooses which player's characters go first. This rule only has a significant application in limited cases, such as when a Traitor card is in play.
9) A 12 creature minimum is required in each play deck's hazard mix. Creatures that are also events count as only half a creature towards this limit (rounding down). Such creatures include the Nazgul, Mouth of Sauron, and Shelob. Sideboards have no such creature restrictions. Dragon &quotAhunt" and At Home" manifestations count as half a creature for these purposes. Agents (introduced in Middle-earth: Dark Minionsª) also count as half a creature for these purposes.
10) The minimum number of hazards and resources in a play deck is increased from 25 and 25 to 30 and 30.
11) Up to 3 of the same Wizard or up to 2 of the same Wizard and 1 of a different Wizard may be included in a play deck.
12) Only one of each unique card and a maximum of three of any other cards can be included in a player's play deck, sideboard, and starting cards collectively. As an exception, a player may include 2 or 3 of the same Wizard in his or her play deck. No Wizards are allowed in the sideboard.
13) A card that can be played as either a resource or as a hazard can be counted in either the resource mix or hazard mix of a deck for the purposes of including an equal number of resources and hazards.
14) Players and the coordinator should make certain that, for standard rules games, all of the Marshalling point modifications printed on page 50 of the Middle-earth: The Wizardsª Unlimited Edition rulesbook and on page 32 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion are properly accounted for. These modifications are to be interpreted in the order they are printed.
RULES OF ETIQUETTE

15) Deck Construction--The cards used in deck building may be from any edition or expansion of the MECCG (including foreign translations and official promotional cards). The mechanics of any given card will be determined from the most recent English printing (as well as from official errata and the official rulings). No proxy cards will be allowed. Cards from any particular expansion may only be used in Council events after a minimum time of 30 days following their official retail release has passed.
16) Deck Integrity--Each player is required to use the same play deck, sideboard, and pool of starting characters for the entire tournament. No card substitutions are allowed between games. A player must start each game with the same cards in his or her play deck, sideboard, and pool of starting characters as he or she started the tournament. The tournament coordinator may choose to require each player to submit a written copy of all cards in his or her play deck, sideboard, and pool of starting characters before playing (spot checks may be used to ensure decks are legal).
17) Marked Cards--A player may petition the tournament coordinator to disallow a non-location card from an opponent's cards, if the offending card has a distinguishing mark, tear, or fold visible on its generic side.
18) Protective Sleeves--A player may play with his or her cards in protective sleeves unless the tournament coordinator requires the cards to be taken out of the sleeves. An opponent may petition the tournament coordinator to require that a player remove his or her cards from their protective sleeves, if the opponent reasonably believes that one of the following rules is being violated.
Each of a player's cards must be in the same make of protective sleeve.
Each card must be oriented the same way with respect to the opening of the sleeve.
No distinguishing marks or inconsistent degree of wear is allowed on individual sleeves.
Only one card is allowed in each sleeve.
19) Shuffling--All deck shuffling must be made above the edge of the table (in clear view of your opponent). After you shuffle your cards at least three times, your opponent will be allowed to shuffle your cards and/or cut your deck up to three times. An opponent must shuffle a player's cards in a manner that will not damage the cards physical integrity. It is highly recommended that an opponent shuffle a player's cards by dealing them out in some number of face-down stacks.
20) Conventions of Play--Each player and opponent should make sure that any conventions used for card play (including denoting play decks and discard piles) are obvious and agreed upon by both players.
21) Finishing Games--When a game is finished, both players should leave their cards on the playing surface and notify the tournament coordinator that their game is finished. Players do not pick up their cards until the tournament coordinator says so. The tournament coordinator has the option of observing the game's final position and tallying the game's score and tournament points to be awarded. The tournament coordinator may announce that, if both players agree on their game, they can pick up their cards and report their game's results to the coordinator without inspection.
22) Players that Stall--If an opponent is believed to be stalling for purposeful gain, or if an opponent is believed to be stalling through a lack of respect for or sensitivity to the time limit, the player can petition the tournament coordinator to observe the game. If the coordinator observes that the opponent is stalling more than what is reasonable and necessary, the coordinator can call the game in favor of the non-stalling player. In a Swiss System format (see below), the player receives the maximum tournament points for the capability of his or her deck. The tournament coordinator would have to make a judgment as to what the deck's capability is. There are exactly two choices: the deck is either capable of destroying The One Ring [must have a ring test (not counting Ringlores or Tests of Lore) and three Precious Gold Rings in the starting play deck, and must have The One Ring and either the Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate and Gollum in the starting play deck or sideboard]; or the deck is only capable of the maximum Marshalling points win. Note that a player receives tournament points for a ratio of his or her Marshalling points with the opponent's if time is called.
23) Players Dropping Out--A player should be discouraged from dropping out of a game before the game has reached its natural conclusion. A player is expected to drop out of the tournament between rounds if he or she believes he or she will be unable to complete the following round's game. Certain emergencies cannot be avoided though, and a player may be forced to drop out of a game. If a player drops out of a game, he or she drops out of the tournament, cannot reenter the tournament in a later round, and receives no consideration for prizes or tournament ranking. If a player drops out of the game, the player concedes the game and the opponent receives the win. In a Swiss System format (see below), the opponent receives the maximum tournament points for the capability of his or her deck. The tournament coordinator would have to make a judgment as to what the deck's capability is. There are exactly two choices: the deck is either capable of destroying The One Ring [must have a ring test (not counting Ringlores or Tests of Lore) and three Precious Gold Rings in the starting play deck, and must have The One Ring and either the Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate and Gollum in the starting play deck or sideboard]; or the deck is only capable of the maximum Marshalling points win.
24) Rules Violations during Play--Rules violations will probably occur in tournaments, especially now in the younger days of the MECCG. It is suggested that these violations not be policed or worried about until a player involved notes it. At that point in the game, the correct rule is adopted. Previous violations are not affected or retroactively corrected. For example, if a player chooses Sting (a unique minor item) for his starting company, and his opponent notices after the first turn of the game that unique minor items may not be chosen for starting companies, do not replace Sting at this point. If the opponent noticed the violation before either player had taken a first turn, the offending player must replace Sting with a non-unique minor item. The tournament coordinator may choose to immediately correct any rules violations brought to his or her attention.
25) Cheating--If a player cheats, he or she is immediately ejected from the event. In a Swiss System format (see below), an opponent receives the maximum tournament points for the capability of his or her deck. The tournament coordinator would have to make a judgment as to what the deck's capability is. There are exactly two choices: the deck is either capable of destroying The One Ring [must have a ring test (not counting Ringlores or Tests of Lore) and three Precious Gold Rings in the starting play deck, and must have The One Ring and either the Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate and Gollum in the starting play deck or sideboard]; or the deck is only capable of the maximum Marshalling points win.
CLARIFICATIONS AND RULINGS
26) Legal Play of Cards--A player may not play a card just to discard it (i.e., just get it out of his or her hand). Specifically, a card may only be played if it meets at least one of the following criteria.
1) The card must have an immediate effect on the game.

2) The card is a long-event. Long-events can always be played, even if ultimately they will not affect play.

3) The card has a potential effect on play that could be triggered later (e.g., the second use of Dragon's Desolation). Most permanent-events fall into this category. Only those that are playable on or with a certain entity are restrictive. For example, you cannot play a corruption card if no character exists that would be affected by it.

In all cases, if a card "cannot; be duplicated," a second copy of that card cannot be played--unless the first copy of the card is targeted for removal earlier in the same chain of effects when the second copy is played. This is a clarification of Annotation 11 given on page 50 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion.

27) A player may not play any resources during the opponent's turn. Additionally, a player may not actively engage any resource or character effect during the opponent's turn (e.g., a player may not tap a Palant'r during the opponent's turn). A player may not play any hazards and may not actively engage any hazard permanent-events, etc. outside of the opponent's movement/hazard phase.
28) A player may not target an opponent's characters, companies, items, followers, etc. with his or her own resources. Of course, resource long-events and other cards which do not target and have global effects will affect opponent's cards.
29) A card's text takes precedence if it contradicts a rule of the game (or these rules).
30) Certain cards, effects, and/or rules allow a player to search for cards and add them to his or her hand, play deck, or discard pile outside of the normal sequence of play (i.e., in addition to filling out the hand and drawing cards when a company moves). A player may or may not be required to reveal some or all of the identity of such manipulated cards. Given below is a list of all such effects and cards included in MECCG and the official ruling on how the implementing player must reveal the manipulated cards, if at all. If multiple cards are manipulated at a time (e.g., exchanging cards with the sideboard when a play deck is exhausted), the player must declare the number of cards so manipulated. [Key: RE--the manipulated card must be revealed to an opponent; RR--enough of the manipulated card's face must be revealed to show opponent that it is a resource/character; RH--enough of the manipulated card's face must be revealed to show opponent that it is a hazard; NR--the manipulated card need not be revealed to opponent.]
Bringing a resource/character in from the sideboard to the play deck or discard pile (by tapping a Wizard)--RR

Bringing a hazard in from the sideboard to the play deck or discard pile (by tapping a Nazgl permanent-event or by option when op-ponent's Wizard is revealed--see below)--RH

Exchanging cards from the sideboard with the play deck when a player exhausts his or her deck--NR

31) All rulings from the Council of Lórien ruling file (compiled by Craig &quotIchabod" O'Brien) given on ICE's WEB page at &quothttp://www.ironcrown.com" are official rulings for use with Council events.
ADDITIONAL RULES
In addition to these guidelines, a few rules not presented in the METW rulesbook take effect for tournament play. These rules are presented in the expansion Middle-earth: The Dragons.

32) Removing Corruption Cards--A character may choose to ignore the restriction that he or she tap to remove a corruption card (as printed on a corruption card), and suffer a -3 penalty to the dice roll to remove it. This means a character can remain untapped to remove a corruption card and modify his roll by -3. The character can remove a corruption card when already tapped (or wounded) and modify his roll by -3. A character may only attempt to remove each corruption card once per turn if he or she ignores the tapping restriction to do so.
33) Larger Sideboard--The sideboard (which is not used with starter rules) has been increased by 5 cards for all standard rules game formats. This means, for example, that in a standard rules 1-deck and 2-deck game, the sideboard must contain 20 cards.
34) Accessing Hazards in Sideboard--A player can access hazard cards in his or her sideboard when the opponent's Wizard is in play. A player must do this at the end of the opponent's untap phase. Specifically, the player may either bring up to 5 hazard cards from the sideboard into the discard pile, or 1 hazard card from the sideboard into the play deck (if at least 5 cards are in the play deck). In either case, the hazard limit against all of the opponent's companies this turn is halved, rounded up.
THE SWISS SYSTEM FORMAT
As of October 1st 1996, the Council of Lórien has adopted a Swiss System official tournament format. This tournament format allows the success of each player to be determined by a total of tournament points awarded from the play of several games, thereby decreasing the deterministic role of luck in each game.

The Swiss System format can be used for any of the actual types of games being run (two-deck standard rules, sealed deck starter rules, scenario, etc.). The guidelines below are assuming a game type using the Free Council will be run. This is as opposed to a Resource/Character scenario tournament; see the special section below for specific suggestions on running a Resource/Character scenario tournament. Here are the basics the Swiss System tournament structure that The Council of Lórien has adopted:

Number of rounds--A Swiss System tournament is comprised of a certain number of rounds as dictated by the number of participants in the tournament.
2 players 1 round
[cannot be an official Council event]

3 - 4 players 2 rounds
[cannot be an official Council event]

5 - 12 players 3 rounds

13 - 32 players 4 rounds

33 - 64 players 5 rounds

65 - 128 players 6 rounds

129 + players 7 rounds

Each player may participate and play (unless a bye is given) in each round if he or she desires.
Awarding Byes--For each round, it must be determined if an even or odd number of players are participating. If an odd number are participating, one player is given a &quotbye". The player given the bye does not play a game that round. If a bye needs to be given for the first round, the tournament coordinator randomly chooses a player from all players. This player is given a number of tournament points reflecting a win (6 tournament points, see below). If a bye needs to be given for any later rounds, the tournament coordinator randomly chooses one player from the group of players having the lowest tournament point totals. This player is given a number of tournament points reflecting a tie (3 tournament points, see below). After awarding one player a bye, an even number of players will remain to play in the round. It is encouraged that the tournament coordinator take steps to avoid giving a bye for the first round.
With an even number of players participating in a round, players are paired off. Paired players play one game within a time limit. Specific game rules and time limits are dictated by the game type of the tournament (two-deck standard rules, sealed deck starter rules, scenario, etc.).
For the first round only, players are paired off randomly (i.e., each player has zero tournament points).
Pairing Players (Tournaments over 16 players)--For each round after the first round, each player is paired off with another player with the exact same total of tournament points. A tournament coordinator begins pairing each round with the group of players who have the highest total tournament points. When pairings are being determined, choose a player at random from the pool of available players with the same total of tournament points, and then choose the player with whom he or she is paired. If more than one eligible player exists with whom a player may be paired, the second player is determined randomly from all eligible players. If no eligible players exist with whom a player may be paired, the player is paired with a player with the next lowest total tournament points (chosen randomly if more than one player exists with the next lowest total).
Pairing Players (Tournaments less 16 players)--As above, except that tournament coordinators should try and avoid having the same players play each other more than once. If a player's tournament points indicate that he should face an opponent he has already faced, randomly choose a player from with the next lowest number of tournament points instead.
Each player is awarded a certain number of tournament points based upon the result of each game he or she plays. When a game is finished, both players should leave their cards on the playing surface and notify the tournament coordinator that their game is finished. The tournament coordinator would then have the option of observing the game's final position and tallying the game's score and tournament points to be awarded.
Upon completing a game, a player must notify the tournament coordinator if he or she intends not to participate in the next round. A player can feel free to drop out of the tournament after any round, but the player would then be ineligible to reenter the tournament and ineligible to receive any prize or ranking consideration.
A total of accumulated tournament points is kept for each player. The winner of the tournament is the player with the most tournament points when all rounds of the tournament are completed. Runners-up can also be determined at that time by the ranks of their tournament point totals.
Tournament Points--A player is awarded a number of tournament points for the following game results (only one result can apply to each player at the conclusion of each of his or her games). The letter preceding each result denotes the result type (and is used to break tournament ties).
(a) Destroying The One Ring (i.e., successfully playing Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate)--
10 (in sealed deck game), 8 (in a single-deck game), 7 (in a two-deck, three-deck, or campaign game);

(b) Defeating opponent with a Marshalling Points Ratio of 2 or greater--6; or
opponent's Wizard being eliminated if, at the moment of the Wizard's elimination, opponent has fewer than one and a half as many raw Marshalling points than the player--6;

(c) Defeating opponent with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 2 but greater than
or equal to 1.5--5; or
opponent's Wizard being eliminated if, at the moment of the Wizard's elimination, opponent has fewer than twice as many raw Marshalling points than the player but more than one and a half as many--5;

(d) Defeating opponent with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 1.5 but greater than one--4; or
opponent's Wizard being eliminated if, at the moment of the Wizard's elimination, opponent has twice as many or more raw Marshalling points than the player--4;

(e) Defeating opponent with the Weakest Link Method of breaking ties
at the Free Council--3.5;

(f) Achieving a tie as per items 6 and 7 under GENERAL at the top of this document--3; or receiving a bye--6 for the first round,
--3 for a later round;

(g) Losing with the Weakest Link Method of breaking ties at the Free Council--2.5;

(h) Losing to an opponent who wins
by result (d) above--2;

(i) Loosing to an opponent who wins by result (c) above--1;

(j) Losing the game otherwise--0.

Tournament Point Ties--When all rounds are completed, it is possible that more than one player will have the same highest tournament point total (i.e., the leaders will be tied). Before the tournament begins, the tournament coordinator posts how this situation will be resolved. The three options are:
i)The following menu of tie-breaking criteria is followed. Each tied participant is in contention until a criterion is resolved that takes him or her out of contention. Those leading participants removed from contention are relegated to the tier of runners-up (and possibly could face another series of tie-breaking criteria--see below). The coordinator resolves the list of criteria in the order given, establishing each player removed from contention, until one player is left in contention, or until the entire list of criteria is resolved and a tie still exists (see below for this case).

I. Head-to-Head. Tally the number of losses of each tied player from all games played with any other tied players. The players with the fewest total head-to-head losses stay in contention. All other players are out of contention.

II. Destroying the One Ring. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game by successfully playing Cracks of Doom or Gollum's Fate (i.e., method a). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

III. Highest MP Ratio. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game with a Marshalling Points Ratio of 2 or greater or by the opponent's Wizard being eliminated with a minimum Marshalling point achievement (i.e., method b). The players with the most wins in these manners are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

IV. Next MP Ratio. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 2 but greater than or equal to 1.5 or by the opponent's Wizard being eliminated with a medium Marshalling point achievement (i.e., method c). The players with the most wins in these manners are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

V. Lowest MP Ratio. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game with a Marshalling Points Ratio less than 1.5 but greater than one or by the opponent's Wizard being eliminated with a maximum Marshalling point achievement (i.e., method d). The players with the most wins in these manners are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

VI. Weakest Link Method Win. Tally the number of times each player still in contention won a game by the Weakest Link Method as a result of a tie at the Free Council (i.e., method e). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

VII. Receiving a Bye/Tying. Tally the number of times each player still in contention received a bye or tied (i.e., method f). The players with the most wins in these manners are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

VIII. Weakest Link Method Loss. Tally the number of times each player still in contention lost a game by the Weakest Link Method as a result of a tie at the Free Council (i.e., method g). The players with the most wins in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

IX. Marginal Loss. Tally the number of times each player still in contention lost a marginal game (i.e., method h). The players with the most losses in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

X. Respectable Loss. Tally the number of times each player still in contention lost respectably (i.e., method i). The players with the most losses in this manner are in contention. All other players are out of contention.

 

If more than one player is still in contention after criterion VII is resolved, these players are considered tied once again. They tournament coordinator either invokes option (ii) or (iii), as he or she has posted.

Note that in the future, when a national ranking system is established, one of the tie-breaking criteria with be the collective strength of opponents faced.

ii) Playoff rounds are held. The playoff rounds are formatted in the same manner as the tournament. See the Number of Rounds note above regarding the number of rounds to be played.

iii) No tie breaker actions are taken, and each tied participant is recognized as co-champion. The pre-determined prizes for the number of top finishers equal to the number of co-champions should be divided up and awarded evenly amongst the co-champions.

It is recommended that the following exact policy for breaking ties be used, and, thus, declared before the tournament starts:

"If; multiple players are tied with the most tournament points after all rounds of the regular Swiss System are complete, the menu of tie-breaking criteria will be invoked. After this, if more than one player remains in contention, a playoff of Swiss System rounds will be held amongst the players still in contention."

If multiple players are tied in a lower tier, the previously mentioned guidelines also apply. Replacing the concept of players carrying the most points with players tied carrying the same number of points.

The tie-breaking policy requires that tournament coordinators keep a running record of each player's opponent each round, result types each round, as well as tournament point results each round. See player's tournament card included with the tournament packet from the Council of Lórien.

Time Limits--Each game has a time limit that depends on the type of game being played. The time limit is the amount of time allowed for the play of games. A tournament coordinator needs to consider an additional 10 minutes or so between rounds for administrative tasks. Also, a coordinator needs to consider an amount of start-up time (20 minutes or so).
single-deck game starter rules--50 minutes

single-deck game standard rules--50 minutes

two-deck game--1 hour and 20 minutes

three-deck game--2 hours

campaign game--3 hours

sealed deck game starter rules--50 minutes*

sealed deck game standard rules--50 minutes*

resource/character scenario game--1 hour*

* See the descriptions of the different games below for further information.

A tournament coordinator will have an official time keeping device. He or she should announce the time 10 minutes before final time will be called. When the time limit is reached according to the official time keeping device, play of each game continues until: the player who went second in the game finishes a turn (i.e., both players play the same number of turns); or until the Free Council is called normally according to the rules. After the player who went second finishes his or her turn, the Free Council begins automatically, regardless of Marshalling Point totals.
Marshalling Point Ratios--If, at the Free Council after the final Marshalling Point (MP) totals have been tallied (including all standard rules interpretations), one player has more MPs than the opponent, that player wins. The winner receives either 4, 5, or 6 tournament points depending upon the ratio of his MP total to the opponent's (see above). The loser receives 2, 1, or 0 points respectively. To determine a winner's MP ratio, divide the winner's total MPs by the loser's MPs. A loser with zero or negative MPs automatically gives the winner 6 tournament points (and a method b win).
If, at the Free Council after the final MP totals have been tallied (including all standard rules interpretations), both players have the same number of MPs (i.e., they are tied), use the Weakest Link Method to determine a winner and a loser (see above). The winner receives 3 tournament points; the looser receives 2.
TOURNAMENT PRIZE POLICIES Tournament coordinators of sanctioned tournaments will be provided with the following items, in addition to any product, as prize support: a silver Wizard's Ring Certificate; a gold Council Coin; a silver Council Coin; and a number of Sage Pins. These items are to be distributed as follows:

Tournament Place	Prize
Tournament Winner	Wizard's Ring Certificate
1st Runner Up	Gold Council Coin
2nd Runner Up	Silver Council Coin
1st time a player wins a game	Sage pin for the Wizard the player was playing
The Wizard's Ring Certificate should be filled out by the tournament coordinator before being awarded to the Winner. The Winner can send the certificate back to ICE where we will process it and send a Wizard's Ring back to the Winner. Winners do not need to include postage to have the Wizard's Ring sent back to them.

Only one Sage pin should be given out to each player who qualifies (i.e., wins a game) during each tournament. Organizers should feel free to let the player choose the Sage pin.

Prize items not awarded should be returned to ICE. GAMES NOT IN THE RULESBOOK The Sealed Deck Game

Due to size considerations, sealed deck tournaments only require a 25/25 card minimum deck size (as printed in the rulesbook). For a sealed deck game tournament, each player receives a starter deck and three booster packs. ICE suggest using either 3 boosters from Middle-earth The Wizards, or 1 booster from Middle-earth the Wizards and two from either Middle-earth: Dragons or Middle-earth: Dark Minions. No other cards are allowed in the play area besides the cards received from the Tournament Coordinator. Tournament coordinators should feel free to enforce this policy any way they see fit.

Tournament coordinators are expected to advertise the event ahead of time and charge an entrance fee to cover the cost of purchasing the decks from ICE (see below). ICE suggests an entrance fee of $10.

Each player is allowed 45 minutes to construct a deck for a one-deck game. It will have to determined if standard or starter rules are being used by the tournament coordinator. It should be noted that on average, seven cards (not counting region cards) from each player's set of cards will not be playable at all. Players should be aware of this extra baggage when constructing their decks. If a player does not have 25 playable hazards or resources, he or she should play with all that he or she does have, and still play with 25 of the other.

Players may exchange cards between his or her deck and the set of cards he received but did not use between rounds. Such exchanges must be completed in the time allotted between rounds and may not interfere with the running of the tournament (i.e., when the Tournament Coordinator announces that the players are to pair up and begin the next round players must immediately stop exchanging cards and get ready to play the next round).

Tournament coordinators can purchase product from ICE for Sanctioned or Qualified sealed deck tournaments. Coordinators will generally be limited to 16 decks for any one retail event and 32 for any one other type of event. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis and is subject to availability as ICE inventory allows. Coordinators must submit a flyer or handbill as evidence that participants are being recruited in advance and that entry fees are being charged, and confirming the date and place of the event. Unsold inventory should be returned to ICE for a refund to the purchaser. Coordinators can contact Monica Wilson at (804) 295-4280 for further information on this.

The Resource/Character Scenario Game

It is recommended that resource/character scenarios be considered by a tournament coordinator who has the means of communicating to all players in advance what the pool of scenarios will be for the tournament. It is suggested that the coordinator post (in advance) three resource/character scenarios that will be used for the tournament. Each player comes to the tournament with a deck constructed for his or her chosen scenario.

Present Official Scenarios--Presently, the three scenarios for official Council event tournaments are:
1) A Hobbit's Quest (found on page 72 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion)

2) Barrels out of Bond (found on page 66 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion)

3) The King beneath the Mountains (found on page 67 of the Middle-earth: The Wizards Companion)

A complete copy of these scenarios can also be found on the ICE WEB page at &quothttp://www.ironcrown.com."
Resource/character scenario game tournaments can be run within the same tournament Swiss System structure as the other Free Council games (which are the games presented in the rulesbook). Each player attempts to complete the victory conditions of his or her chosen scenario instead of playing for the Free Council. After starting characters are revealed, each player must announce to the opponent which scenario he or she has chosen. The opponent then knows what victory conditions the player is trying to achieve.

Other resource/character scenarios can be used if approved by the Council of Lórien. To obtain permission, the tournament coordinator must submit a written proposal for the scenarios he or she proposes to use. Original scenarios so submitted become the property of Iron Crown Enterprises, which may choose to publish them (with credit to the original designer).

Time Limit--For a Resource/Character Scenario tournament game, time is called after one hour . If, at this point, no player has achieved the victory conditions for his or her scenario, the player who currently is taking his or her turn finishes the turn. If the opponent did not have the first turn, the opponent then takes one final turn (i.e., both players get the same number of turns). Assuming in the interim no player achieves the victory conditions for his or her chosen scenario, the winner is the player who achieves the higher &quotrank" as indicated by his or her specific scenario.
Ties--If both players have achieved the same &quotrank" as indicated by the specific scenarios, the players tie. Each receives 3 tournament points.
Tournament Points--A player is awarded a number of tournament points in a resource/character scenario game for the following game results:
Achieving the victory conditions of his or her chosen scenario--6

Achieving the higher rank at the game's end--4

Tying--3

Losing with a lower rank at the game's end--2

Losing if opponent achieves his or her victory conditions--0
