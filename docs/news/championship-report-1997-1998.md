1997/98 Season MECCGChampionship Report

October 2-4, 1998 in Toledo, OH

A great time was had by all! 16 players came out on Friday for the Open Qualifier, and seven for the Preliminary round. Oskar Silow of Sweden-by way of residence in Pennsylvania-and Michael Yates of South Carolina were the top two finishers from the Open, and they advanced to the semi-final round on Saturday. Six players were normally scheduled to advance from the Preliminary round, but we advanced all seven automatically and played the round for fun. We felt making the exception in this extreme situation was civil and warranted-no semi-final round players objected. Head designer Coleman Charlton jumped into the Preliminary mix and finished somewhere in the middle. Of special note, our recently departed-and superbly talented-net rep, Craig "Ichabod" O'Brien, finished third in the Open Qualifier. We were glad to see him in the field and wish him the best!

The meat of the Championships-the semi-final round-were held on Saturday with a field of 37 players. The final eight advanced to Sunday to determine a champion. Chris Burke of North Carolina and his Fallen Radagast deck emerged victorious after an intense match with Joe Bisz of New York, playing the best One Ring deck I have ever seen. Please check out the Final Standings to see how things finished up.
