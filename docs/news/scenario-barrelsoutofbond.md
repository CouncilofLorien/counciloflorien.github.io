## Barrels out of Bond

For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for the escape of his friends, and at last he had the desperate beginnings of a plan.

Few tasks are so noble as the rescue of one's friends from imprisonment. Often such attempts fail, because of their desperate and improbable nature. Yet to try, to pursue hope, is often better than accepting the loss of those who are dear. And many famous friendships have become the stronger for the debt of freedom.

The players seek to free their friends from the enemy's dungeons. Once liberated, these friends may then join in the search for other prisoners. Players look to free as many characters as possible to win.

### Special Rules

- Put four _Rescue Prisoners_ cards in your resource mix.
- When you play _Rescue Prisoners_, you may put as many characters from your hand under it as you like. However, you must put at least one, or else _Rescue Prisoners_ may not be played. These characters are considered in play, but they have no effect on the game until _Rescue Prisoners_ is stored. Once _Rescue Prisoners_ is stored, the characters may immediately join their host company if there is enough influence to control them. Otherwise, they are discarded. Bringing characters into play via _Rescue Prisoners_ does not count against the limit that only one character may be brought into play during the organization phase.

### Victory Conditions

After you have exhausted you play deck once, you automatically win at the end of a turn if you have four _Rescue Prisoners_ stored. They must each have been played at a different site.

During tournament play, you achieve ranks as follows: 
1. You free a few wobbly captives when you store your first _Rescue Prisoners_.
2. You deliver a small band of stout hearts from behind bars when you store your second _Rescue Prisoners_. 
3. You liberate several prominent personages and valiant warriors when you store your third _Rescue Prisoners_. 
4. You scour the dungeons of the Enemy when you play your fourth _Rescue Prisoners_.
