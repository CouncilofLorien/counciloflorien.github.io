Scenarios
Barrels out of Bond
"For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate,
and wondered if it could be used for the escape of his friends,
and at last he had the desperate beginnings of a plan."
-The Hobbit



"Few tasks are so noble as the rescue of one's friends from imprisonment. Often such attempts fail, because of their desperate and improbable nature. Yet to try, to pursue hope, is often better than accepting the loss of those who are dear. And many famous friendships have become the stronger for the debt of freedom.

The players seek to free their friends from the enemy's dungeons. Once liberated, these friends may then join in the search for other prisoners. Players look to free as many characters as possible to win.



Special Rules
Put four Rescue Prisoners in your resource mix.
When you play Rescue Prisoners, you may put as many characters from your hand under it as you like. However, you must put at least one, or else Rescue Prisoners may not be played. These characters are considered in play, but they have no effect on the game until Rescue Prisoners is stored. Once Rescue Prisoners is stored, the characters may immediately join their host company if there is enough influence to control them. Otherwise, they are discarded. Bringing characters into play via Rescue Prisoners does not count against the limit that only one character may be brought into play during the organization phase.
