This insert provides expansion rules, clarifications, and a scenario for use with both _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ (_METW_) and _Middle-earth: The Dragons_ (_METD_). These rules are recommended for all _METW_ games even if _METD_ is not used.

### KEY WORDS AND TERMS (_Clarification_)

A "key word" is an identifier for a card which makes it affectable by _or_ usable with other cards as the cards' text dictate. For example, in _METW_, key words include: Orc, spell, environment, Dragon, Undead, Wolves, etc.

_Middle-earth: The Dragons_ introduces several "key words" to the Middle-earth collectible card game: Drake, light enchantment, dark enchantment, ritual, riddling attempt, riddling roll, offering attempt, flattery attempt, capture,[^capture] and helmet. There are no special rules for these key words; except that a character may only use the effects of one helmet at a time. Note that the key words, Dragon and Drake, are mechanically independent. Some of the key words are not affected by any currently existing cards (e.g., offering attempt and capture), but they will be with the release of future expansions.

A "bearer" of a specific card refers to the character that bears or controls that card.

### DRAGON LAIRS

Any site with a Dragon automatic-attack is a Dragon's lair. There are nine unique Dragons associated with the following lairs:

| Dragon | Lair (site) | Lair's Region | 
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
Agburanar |  Caves of Ulund  |  Withered Heath
Bairanax  | Ovir Hollow  |  Grey Mountain Narrows
Daelomin  |  Dancing Spire | Withered Heath
Earcaraxe  | Isle of the Ulond  |  Andrast Coast
Itangast |  Gold Hill  | Withered Heath
Leucaruth  | Irerock  |  Withered Heath
Scatha  |  Gondmaeglom  |  Grey Mountain Narrows
Scorba  | Zarak Dum  | Angmar
Smaug  |  The Lonely Mountain  |  Northern Rhovanion

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The normal Dragon automatic-attacks printed on these sites are **not** considered manifestations of the unique Dragon.[^crf-terms-dragon-lairs]

### HOARDS

Certain items are _hoard items_. Such an item may only be played at a site that contains a hoard. Each site which had a Dragon automatic-attack at the beginning of the turn contains a hoard.[^dragon-hoard-errata] A hoard minor item may not be included with a starting company, and may not be played at a site that does not contain a hoard.

{: .note }
> **Example:** You can not play a hoard minor item at Wellinghall after successfully influencing the _Ents of Fangorn_ like you can with a normal minor item. Wellinghall does not contain a hoard.

### MANIFESTATIONS OF DRAGONS

Each of the nine unique Dragons (see above) has four[^four-manifestations] different _manifestations_:

**Basic** — In this manifestation a Dragon is in his standard active mode. Each of these manifestations is represented by a standard creature card (e.g., the cards for Smaug, Agburanar, Daelomin, and Leucaruth from _METW_).

**Ahunt** — In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to be hunting in a wide range of regions. Each of these manifestations is represented by a hazard long-event that will attack any company moving in a given set of regions (e.g., _Smaug Ahunt_ normally causes an attack against any company moving in Withered Heath, Northern Rhovanion, Iron Hills, and/or Grey Mountain Narrows).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If one Ahunt is out and your company moves through two or more of the regions listed on it, then you face the attack once.[^crf-terms-ahunt]

**At Home** — In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to be resident in his lair. Each of these manifestations is represented by a hazard permanent-event that gives its lair an additional automatic-attack and causes certain other global effects (e.g., _Scorba At Home_ gives Zarak Dum an additional automatic-attack and each major item gives an additional corruption point).

**Roused**[^roused] (from _MELE_ and _MEAS_) — In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to have joined forces with a player. Each of these manifestations is represented by a minion faction resource that gives marshalling points and will attack an opponent's companies moving in the same set of regions as the Ahunt manifestation normally attacks.

Different manifestations of the same Dragon may be in play at the same time. The fact that each manifestation is unique unto itself does not preclude the other manifestations.

Only your opponent can receive marshalling points from defeating a manifestation of a Dragon that you played. If you defeat a Dragon manifestation that you played, it is removed from the game and no one receives its marshalling points. 

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If you defeat the attack from a Dragon manifestation, you get kill marshalling points from the manifestation as if you had defeated a creature.[^crf-terms-dragons]
> 
> **Clarification:** If a hero company defeats an attack by a Ringwraith’s Dragon faction, the hero player receives its marshalling points as kill marshalling points.[^mele-mp]
>
> **Clarification:** If a Ringwraith player defeats an attack from a Dragon faction, remove the Dragon from play. That player does not receive its marshalling points.[^mele-factions]
> 
> **Clarification:** [_MELE_, Standard Rules, Combat, Trophies](/original/rulebooks/the-lidless-eye/#trophies): Defeated Dragon manifestations can be used as trophies, including Dragon factions.[^crf-terms-trophies]
> 
> **Clarification:** When a minion company defeats an attack with no * by the MPs, the creature goes to the out-of-play pile belonging to the person who played the attack. They may still be taken as a trophy, but go to the appropriate out-of-play pile when the trophy is discarded.[^crf-turn-attack]

If at any time an attack from a manifestation of a unique Dragon is defeated or if the manifestation is otherwise removed from the game:

 - All existing manifestations in play of the same Dragon are removed from the game.
 - No further manifestations of the same Dragon may be played.
 - The Dragon's lair no longer has an automatic-attack.

{: .note }
> **Example:** You have played _Smaug at Home_ and _Smaug Ahunt_ (both are still in play). Then you play _Dragon's Desolation_ and _Smaug_ on one of your opponent's companies at Weathertop. Your opponent plays _Old Thrush_, rolls lucky, and defeats _Smaug_. He gets 5 MPs for defeating _Smaug_ **and** _Smaug_, _Smaug at Home_, and _Smaug Ahunt_ are all removed from play **and** The Lonely Mountain (Smaug's lair) no longer has an automatic-attack. 
> 
> If, instead, one of your own companies had gone to The Lonely Mountain and defeated _Smaug at Home_, you would not receive the 5 MPs.

### HAZARD LIMIT (_Clarification_)

The base hazard limit is determined (i.e., set) simultaneously at the moment a company reveals its new site or otherwise announces it is beginning its movement/hazard phase. Any cards which modify a company's hazard limit played prior to this point are then immediately applied to the company's base hazard limit in the order chosen by the player controlling the company. With such modifications established, any cards played after this point are interpreted in the order they are resolved. Any effects which modify the hazard limit against a company during its site phase are ignored. Any reduction in the hazard limit during a movement/hazard phase does not affect cards already announced and played.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** The hazard limit is checked at declaration and resolution. At declaration there must be fewer hazards already declared than the hazard limit. At resolution there must be no more hazards declared than the hazard limit.[^crf-turn-hazard-limit]

### CHARACTERS FACING MULTIPLE STRIKES

When certain _Middle-earth: The Dragons_ cards are played, a character may be assigned to receive more than one strike from a given attack. Such a character must face a strike sequence for each strike he is assigned to face. If a character is tapped or wounded following one of these strike sequences, he must then accordingly modify his prowess for any following strike sequences. If a character is eliminated or otherwise removed from play before he has faced all of his assigned strikes, those strikes he has yet to face are then considered to be _successful_.[^dragon-multiple-strike-errata]

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** If an attack states all characters in a company face a strike, then effects which allow a character to face more than one strike have no effect against the attack. Similarly, effects that change the attack’s number of strikes have no effect. As an exception, effects which reduce the number of strikes to a specific number do work.

### REMOVING CORRUPTION CARDS

A character may choose to ignore the restriction that he tap to remove a corruption card (as printed on a corruption card), and suffer a -3 penalty to the dice roll to remove it. This means a character can remain untapped and still attempt to remove a corruption card (the roll is modified by -3), **or** that he can attempt to remove a corruption card even if he is already tapped or wounded (the roll is modified by -3). 

A character may only attempt to remove each corruption card once per turn if he ignores the tapping restriction to do so.

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** A character attempting to remove a corruption card on another character may ignore the tapping requirement and recieve -3 to the roll.[^remove-another-characters-corruption]

{: .note }
> **Example:** During his organization phase, Beorn has 3 corruption cards: _Lure of Nature_, _Lure of Expedience_, and _Lure of the Senses_. He taps and rolls to attempt to remove the _Lure of the Senses_; his roll is an 8, so the card is removed (greater than 6 was required). If, instead, Beorn had not tapped for this attempt, he would have failed (he would have needed to roll a 10 or better). He then rolls to attempt to remove _Lure of Nature_; his roll is a 6 modified by -3 for a net result of 3, so the card is **not** removed (greater than 4 was required). Finally, he rolls to attempt to remove _Lure of Expedience_; his roll is a 9 modified by -3 for a net result of 6, so the card is removed (greater than 5 was required). 

### THE SIDEBOARD

With the publication of _Middle-earth: The Dragons_, the number of different resource and hazard strategies increases dramatically. To enable players to react to more specific strategies during play, the sideboard size is increased by five (e.g., from 15 to 20 for the 1-deck and 2-deck games, from 20 to 25 for the 3-deck game, etc.).

{: .note }
> **Clarification:** With the later set _Middle-earth: The White Hand_,[^mewh-sideboard] the sideboard size is further increased to:
> - 30 cards for the 1-deck game and the 2-deck game.
> - 35 cards for the 3-deck game.
> - 40 cards for the 4-deck game.

At the end of your opponent's untap phase, if your opponent's Wizard is in play, you may at this point bring up to five hazard cards from your sideboard to your discard pile; **or**, if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may bring one hazard card directly from your sideboard into your play deck (reshuffle). If you move cards from your sideboard in this fashion, the hazard limit for each of your opponent's companies is reduced to half of normal (round up, e.g., a hazard limit of 2 becomes 1, a hazard limit of 3 becomes 2, etc.).

{: .note}
> **Clarification:** You can access hazards from your sideboard when your opponent’s Wizard/Ringwraith is in play. You must declare this at the end of your opponent’s untap phase and then access hazards as if you had tapped a Nazgul permanent-event to do so. The hazard limit against all of your opponent’s companies that turn is halved, rounded up. [^crf-terms-sideboard]
> 
> **Clarification:** You may access your sideboard when your opponent plays _The Lidless Eye_ or _Sauron_ as if he had revealed his Ringwraith.[^crf-terms-sideboard]

### REGION MOVEMENT LIMITATION

Normally, a company moving with region movement may lay down a maximum of four region cards. If a company moving with region movement is using effects that allows additional region cards to be laid down, no more than six regions may be used.

# MANY A GLEAMING GOLDEN HOARD

{: .text-center }
_A Scenario For Middle-earth: The Dragons_

To play this scenario, each player will need at the **very** least one starter deck and several boosters from _Middle-earth: The Wizards_ **plus** some _Middle-earth: The Dragons_ (_METD_) booster packs—the exact number of which will depend on the chosen victory conditions.

### Special Rules

Each player is attempting to acquire and store "lost treasures." A lost treasure must be a hoard major or a hoard greater item played at a Dragon's lair. When such an item is played with one of his characters, a player must designate whether or not it is a lost treasure—as limited by the following conditions. Other items may be played normally at Dragons' lairs.

 - Only one lost treasure may be played at each different Dragon's lair. For example, if _Magical Harp_ (a unique hoard major item) is played at The Lonely Mountain and is designated to be a lost treasure, no other lost treasures may be played at The Lonely Mountain.
 - If a player already has one unstored lost treasure in play, he may not designate another hoard major or greater item to be a lost treasure.
 - Any unique hoard major or hoard greater item which has been designated as a lost treasure must retain this designation for the entire game. This distinction applies even if such an item is discarded (e.g., through a failed corruption check, by being influenced away, etc.) and then later brought back into play by either player. In such a case, a lost treasure may be played with a character even if another character under his player's control already bears a lost treasure (i.e., in this case a player could have more than one unstored lost treasure in play).
 - A player's hand size increases by one each time one of his characters stores a lost treasure.

### Victory Conditions

The first player to store five lost treasures wins immediately. If both players have a limited collection of _METD_ cards or want to play a shorter game, this requirement can be reduced to only 2, 3, or 4 lost treasures. For a longer game, you can require that the winner also defeat one or two unique Dragons.
