# Introduction

This is version 16 of the collected clarifications to the rules for the Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game. Some of these clarifications are considered errata to the rules or cards, and are noted as such. The Turn Sequence and Rulings by Term sections are specifically considered clarifications to the rules, and are therefore overridden by card text that specifically does so. A complete list of errata is included. There will be periodic updates to this file, and items marked with a "@" are new or changed since the last version.

The main thing to remember, when making rulings based on the rules and the cards, is that if it isn't there, then it isn't there. If a card says a site counts as a Haven for purposes of healing, that does not mean the site counts as a Haven for any other purposes. If a card says it can be played as a resource, that does not mean it counts as a resource at any time except when it is being played. Remember: ***If it isn't there, it isn't there.***

Tournament rules for MECCG differ slightly from the rules for casual play. Rulings marked with a "#" differ from those in tournament play. When playing in a tournament, be sure to check the Tournament Rulings section.

If you have any further questions concerning MECCG, you may:
