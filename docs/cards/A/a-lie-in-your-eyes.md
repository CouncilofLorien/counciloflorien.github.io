> > Playable on an untapped non-Ringwraith, non-Wizard character. Your opponent may either: tap the character, tap an ally the character controls, or choose for you to make a roll (draw a #). If the result is greater than the character's mind plus 6, the character is discarded (along with all cards he controls).   “‘That won't do... What did you see, and what did you say?’”_ ***---&#65279;LotRIII***
