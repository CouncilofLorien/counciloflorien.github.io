> > Balrog specific. Tap this card when an opponent plays a card normally giving him three or more marshalling points. The card does not untap. If tapped, you may discard this card during your organization phase to target a company allowed to move with region movement. The company may move up to two additional regions if moving to a site where an opponent's company is present-and also, thereafter, when leaving this site.
