If you have more than 7 stage points, all detainment attacks against your companies attack normally instead. If at one of his Wizardhavens \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] when a hazard creature attacks one of your companies, he may immediately join that company. Alatar must face a strike from the creature (in all cases). Following all of the creature's attacks, Alatar must tap (if untapped) and make a corruption check.
