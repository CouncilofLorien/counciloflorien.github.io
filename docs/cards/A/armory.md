> > Only you and your companies can use _Armory._ You may place any minor items from your hand under _Armory_ during your organization phase. A character at a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] can store a minor item under _Armory_ instead of to your marshalling point pile. When you otherwise would be allowed to play a minor item from your hand at a Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)], Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)], or Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)], you may play an item from under _Armory_ instead. If you have at least three minor items under _Armory_, gain 1 marshalling point.
