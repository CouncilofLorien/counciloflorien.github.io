Make a roll during each of your end-of-turn phases if your Fallen-wizard is at a Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)] where information is playable. Add 1 for each A New Ringlord you have in play. If the result is less than 6, your Fallen-wizard is eliminated. If the result is greater than 9, you win the game.
