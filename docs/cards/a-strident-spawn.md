> > Playable if you are Pallando or Saruman and have 6 or more stage points and a protected Wizardhaven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)]. Each of your Half-orcs requires one less point of influence to control. During your organization phase, you may take one Half-orc character from your discard pile to your hand. You may play Half-orc characters at your Wizardhavens \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)], and even if your Fallen-wizard is not there. Cannot be duplicated by a given player.
