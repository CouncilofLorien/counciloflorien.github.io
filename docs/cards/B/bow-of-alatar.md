> > Unique. Alatar specific. Place this card on Alatar if he is in play. If on Alatar, you may tap Bow of Alatar to allow him to face a strike from an attack against his company regardless of the attack's normal capabilities and his status. If such a strike fails, the attack's body is reduced by 1.   "...longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood and strung with a string of elf-hair." ---LotRII
