> > Corruption. Place with any wounded character in a company that just faced a Nazgul attack; the character receives 3 corruption points. Target character makes a body check during each of his organization phases. Whenever target character would normally heal, he instead makes a roll (or draws a #); if this result is greater than 10, he heals normally and this card is removed. This roll is modified by +2 if the character is at a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] and by +2 for each sage in his company that taps in support.
