> > Tap a character to make a burglary attempt at a site in lieu of facing its automatic-attacks. Tap the site and make a roll (or draw a #) modified by +2 if the character is a scout and by +3 if he is a Hobbit. If the result is greater than 10, an item normally playable at the site may be played with the character. If the attempt fails, the character must face all automatic-attacks alone.
