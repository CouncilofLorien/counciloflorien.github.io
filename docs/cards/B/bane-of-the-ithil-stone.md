 - [FAQ #2 (Dec 1995) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-2/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** Does _Bane of the Ithil-stone_ stop me from drawing cards when someone moves?<br>**A:** No. It will only cancel actions that literally cause a player to search throught or look at any pertion of any play deck or discard pile outside the sequence of normal play. It will cancel _Vilya_, which allows Elrondâ€™s player to look through their discard pile and put 5 cards into their play deck; and it will cancel _Lucky Search_. _Bane of the Ithil-stone_ will not stop an effect which allows a player to bring cards from their sideboard into their discard pile or play deck. Neither will it affect an action which otherwise only causes a player to reshuffle their play deck.

 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - CARD ERRATA AND RULINGS, Bane of the Ithil-stone](/original/rulings/crf-1/#bane-of-the-ithil-stone)<br>_Bane of the Ithil-stone_ will only cancel effects outside of normal play. It will not stop you from drawing cards when moving or discarding and drawing at the end of the turn. It will not stop getting cards from the sideboard. It will stop looking thourgh the discard piles or play decks. This will stop cards like _Far Sight_, _the Nazgul are Abroad_, _Lucky Search_, and _From the Pits of Angbad_.
