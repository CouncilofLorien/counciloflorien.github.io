> > _Sage only._ Playable on an untapped sage during the site phase at a Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)] in a Wilderness \[![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg)]. Opponent must reveal to you a non-Ringwraith, non-Wizard character from his hand if available; otherwise he must reveal his entire hand. If a character is so revealed, make a roll (or draw a #). If the sage is a Ringwraith, modify the roll by -2. According to the result, you may play an item from your hand with the sage (tapping the sage): The One Ring (10, 11, 12), a Dwarven Ring (8, 9, 10, 11, 12), or a Spirit Ring (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
