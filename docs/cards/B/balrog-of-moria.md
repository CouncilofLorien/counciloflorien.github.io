 - [FAQ #3 (Jan 1996) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-3/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** If the _Balrog of Moria_ is in play and Galadriel gets killed, what happens in Lorien?<br>**A:** Though it makes little sense, the “In addition” section is not used because she is “out-of-play.”
 - [FAQ #4 (Jan 1996) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-4/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** If I play the _Balrog_ and then kill it do I get the MP’s?<br>**A:** No.
 - [FAQ #5 (Feb 1996) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-5/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** If the _Balrog of Moria_ is in play and Galadriel gets killed, what happens in Lorien?<br>**A:** The “In addition” section is not used because she is “out-of-play.” The ring of Galadriel (Nenya) and her spirit are assumed to inhabit Lorien if she dies.
 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - TURN SEQUENCE, Site Phase, On-Guard Cards](/original/rulings/crf-1/#on-guard-cards)<br>_Balrog of Moria_ could be revealed when a company chooses to face the automatic-attacks at Moria (_Balrog_ modifies Moria’s automatic-attacks). However, it could not be revealed in response to the play of an item at Moria because _Balrog_ in no way can affect the company for the rest of the site phase (unless for some reason the company is fated to face the automatic-attacks again).
 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - TURN SEQUENCE, Site Phase, On-Guard Cards](/original/rulings/crf-1/#on-guard-cards)<br>Some long- and permanent-events (like _Awaken Denizens_) can be revealed on-guard and effect multiple companies. These cards specify that they affect “each” or “all” sites of a certain type.
