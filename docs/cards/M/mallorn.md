> > _**Unique.**_ Playable only if Earth of Galadriel's Orchard is stored at Bag End. Bag End becomes a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] for the purposes of healing and bringing characters into play. Bag End can untap during its owner's untap phase. If Bag End is discarded, return it to its location deck. All Hobbit factions are worth +1 marshalling points.
