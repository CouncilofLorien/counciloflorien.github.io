> > _Unique._ ***Playable with a Sage or Dwarf only during the site phase at The Under-gates if you have a stored Vein of Arda.*** Sage or Dwarf may not untap until _Mithril_ is stored at a Haven <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr>. _Mithril_ is worth 7 marshalling points when stored. During any organization phase in which you store _Mithril_, you may immediately tap a character in the same company and play with him a non-unique, non-special weapon, armor, shield, or helmet from your hand or discard pile. When _Mithril_ is stored, each Dwarf in play must immediately make a corruption check modified by -3.
