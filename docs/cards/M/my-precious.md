> > _**Unique.**_ _Manifestation of Gollum._ _Agent._ May take an extra agent action (not counting against the hazard limit) each time he normally takes an agent action. If he attacks successfully against a company with a ring, he and a ring (attacker's choice) are discarded. If _My Precious_ attacks and fails but is not defeated, the defender may tap a character in the target company to play _Gollum_ (_My Precious_ is discarded). Any player whose character eliminates _My Precious_ receives -1 kill MPs.
