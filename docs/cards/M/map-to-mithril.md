> > Playable on a Dwarf during the site phase at a site at which "Information" is playable. Tap the Dwarf and site. Tap Map to Mithril if bearer is ever at Moria; this card never untaps. If Map to Mithril is at a Dwarf-hold and it is tapped, the bearer may tap himself and place this card with a non-unique weapon in his company. This gives the weapon a +3 prowess bonus.
