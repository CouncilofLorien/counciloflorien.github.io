> > Unique. May not be played if The Iron Crown is in play. The prowess of one strike of an attack by an Orc, Troll, Man, or Nazgul creature is increased by +4. After the attack is resolved, if the creature is not a Nazgul: the creature is removed from play (defender receives the marshalling points); and, in addition, if the defender has the Iron Crown in his hand, he may immediately play it with a character in the defending company.  "...and now he has come again, bringing ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death." ---LotRV
