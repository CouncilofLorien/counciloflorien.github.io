Any character designated as tapping in support gives +1 to an influence attempt or to an attempt to remove a corruption card by any other character in the company. The mind of each character and ally in the company is increased by one. Discard when any play deck is exhausted, a Wizard joins the company, or any character in the company splits off into another company.
