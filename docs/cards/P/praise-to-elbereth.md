 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - RULINGS BY TERM, Attack](/original/rulings/crf-1/#attack)<br>In order to cancel an attack or to directly affect an attack, the character doing so must be in the company facing the attack. Note that the region/site type a hazard creature is keyed to (when declared) can be affected otherwise.
