If on Pallando, you may tap Pallando's Hood during your end-of-turn phase to take Gifts as Given of Old, Wizard's Voice, or Eyes of Mandos from your discard pile to your hand.  "...even as the stars moved in Endor's skies, so the spangles on Pallando's hood mirrored the heaven's gyrations." ---Kuduk Lore
