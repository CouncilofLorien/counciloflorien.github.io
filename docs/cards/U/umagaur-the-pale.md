Any non-unique Orc or Troll hazard creature can be played (not counting against the hazard limit) on a company that has faced Umagaur that turn.  "Then came Umagaur the Warlord, 'Werewolf-slayer,' self proclaimed 'Troll-king of the Hithaeglir.' And in his wrath he slew most of the Dwarf-company." ---Kuduk Lore
