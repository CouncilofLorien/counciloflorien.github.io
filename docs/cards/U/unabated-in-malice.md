> > Playable on an automatic-attack from Shelob; does not count against the hazard limit. The attack receives +1 prowess, and -2 body. The first attempt to cancel this attack instead cancels the effects of this card. Cannot be duplicated on a given attack.   "Her vast belly was above him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down."_ ***---LotRIV***
