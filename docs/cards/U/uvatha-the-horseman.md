As a creature, may also be played keyed to Harondor, Horse Plains, Gorgoroth, and Khand; and may also be played at sites in these regions. If played as a permanent-event, it will remain in play until tapped during the opponent's movement/hazard phase (tapping counts against the hazard limit). When tapped, Uvatha the Horseman becomes a short-event and you may bring one hazard creature from your discard pile to your hand.
