Influence checks he makes against hero resources are modified by: -9 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 18, -7 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 12, -5 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 7, -3 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 3, -1 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 0 (use the first modifier that applies). Additionally, his Elf characters and Elf factions are each worth 0 marshalling points. Cannot be duplicated on a given Fallen-wizard. Discard when any play deck is exhausted.
