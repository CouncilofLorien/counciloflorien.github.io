> > Playable on a character facing a spider attack. If the strike is successful, target character is not harmed and is taken prisoner at a Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)]. During his untap phase, make a body check for that character modified by +1. If not eliminated, his player then makes a roll (draws a #) adding his body. If the result is greater than 15, the character is automatically rescued into his own company located at the rescue site. Rescue-attack: Spiders-3 strikes with 9 prowess.
