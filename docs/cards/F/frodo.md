 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - RULINGS BY TERM, Hobbits](/original/rulings/crf-1/#hobbits)<br>Hobbit characters may only be brought into play at havens if it is the start of the game and they are your starting characters. If a Hobbit is a starting character and leaves play, then it may only be normally brought back into play at Bag End.
