 - [FAQ #3 (Jan 1996) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-3/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** If I stay at an untapped site during my movement and play a _Foul Fumes_ during my opponent’s movement, does my site tap?<br>**A:** No. This is because the site path when you do not move consists of only the site type.
 - [FAQ #5 (Feb 1996) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-5/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** If I stay at an untapped site during my movement and play a _Foul Fumes_ during my opponent’s movement, does my site tap?<br>**A:** Yes. The site path to consider for the second paragraph of _Foul Fumes_ is the one listed on the site card, not the company’s site path.
