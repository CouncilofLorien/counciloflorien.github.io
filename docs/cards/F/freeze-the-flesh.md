> > _Magic._ _Shadow-_Magic.__ Playable on a character that was eliminated by a body check this turn if a shadow-magic-using character is in his company. Return the character to the company and tap him. Target character has -2 mind to a minimum of 1, -1 prowess, and -2 body. The character's company is now overt. Unless he is a Ringwraith, the shadow-magic using character makes a corruption check modified by -4.
