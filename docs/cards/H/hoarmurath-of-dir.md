As a creature, may also be played keyed to Dagorlad, Ithilien, Gorgoroth, and Khand; and may also be played at sites in these regions. If played as a permanent-event, it will remain in play until tapped during the opponent's movement/hazard phase (tapping counts against the hazard limit). When tapped, Hoarmurath of Dir becomes a short-event and gives +1 strike to any one attack.
