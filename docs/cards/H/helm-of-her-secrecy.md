> > ***If Eowyn is in your hand, this card is playable on a company facing an attack (before strikes are assigned)---the company must contain a character with Edoras as a home site.*** If enough influence is available to control her, Eowyn may be played with (i.e., joins) the company. She gains +2 prowess, +1 body, and +1 direct influence. If the attack is a Nazgul, place _Helm of Her Secrecy_ with Eowyn following the attack. Otherwise, discard this card following the attack. Regardless, Eowyn remains in play.
