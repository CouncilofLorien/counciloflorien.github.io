> > Playable on a non-Ringwraith company that is not moving. Make a roll (or draw a #) for each untapped non-Wizard character in the company; modify this roll by -2 for hero characters. If the result is greater than the character's mind, the character becomes tapped.  Alternatively, may be revealed as an on-guard card on a company after the successful play of an item, ally, or faction. Tapp all untapped non-Ringwraith, non-Wizard characters in the company.
