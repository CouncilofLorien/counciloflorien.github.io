> > _Magic._ _Shadow-_Magic.__ Playable during the site phase by a shadow-magic using character in lieu of declaring an attack against a hero company. The hero company faces an attack of Wolves-4 strikes with 8 prowess. Alternatively, playable on a non-automatic-attack against a shadow-magic-using character. The number of strikes of the attack is reduced to one. Unless he is a Ringwraith, the shadow-magic user makes a corruption check modified by -4.
