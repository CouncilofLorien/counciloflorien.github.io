Make a roll (or draw a #) modified by +3 if the character is a diplomat. An ally may be played and placed under the character's control if the result is greater than 6 plus the ally's mind stat **and** the ally is not restricted from moving in this site's region. If an ally is played, tap the site if it is not already tapped.
