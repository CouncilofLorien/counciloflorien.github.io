> > Tap a character during his site phase at a tapped or untapped Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)]. Make a roll (or draw a #) modified by +3 if the character is a diplomat. An ally may be played and placed under the character's control if the result is greater than 6 plus the ally's mind stat and the ally is not restricted from moving in this site's region. If an ally is played, tap the site if it is not already tapped.
