> > Each company moving in a Dark-domain \[![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg)] draws one less card at the start of its movement/hazard phase (to no minimum). Additionally, any sage at a site in a Dark-domain \[![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg)] or Gorgoroth, or moving with a Dark-domain \[![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg)] or Gorgoroth in his site path, loses his sage skill. No character at a site in a Dark-domain \[![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg)] or Gorgoroth, or moving with a Dark-domain \[![](/assets/images/dark-domain.svg)] or Gorgoroth in his site path, can use spells, light enchantments, or rituals. Discard when any play deck is exhausted.
