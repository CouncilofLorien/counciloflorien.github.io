Bag End becomes a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] for the purposes of healing and bringing characters into play. Bag End can untap during its owner's untap phase. If Bag End is discarded, return it to its location deck. All Hobbit factions are worth +1 marshalling points.   "In the Party Field, a beautiful young sapling leaped up; it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in April." ---LotRVI
