> > ***Playable if you have an ally in your hand.*** When this card is played, place one ally from your hand "off to the side" with it (the ally gives no marshalling points). The ally must be able to be attacked. If an opponent's company moves to a site where the ally is playable, it faces a single-strike attack (with no type) with the attributes of the ally, except the prowess is increased by 7. The attack is detainment if the ally and the company are both minion or both hero; and this card is discarded afterwards. If defeated, discard this card and place the ally in your opponent's marshalling point pile---he receives the ally's marshalling points as kill points. You may return the ally to your hand and discard this card during your organization phase.
