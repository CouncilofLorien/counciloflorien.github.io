> > _Balrog specific._ Playable if The Balrog's company is not at an Under-deeps site and is in company vs. company combat against a company with a Wizard. Discard all allies with no body at the site. Make a roll: for each character at the site with a mind less than 8 and for each ally normally worth less than 3 marshalling points. If the result minus 1 is greater than the character's/ally's body, he is wounded or, if already wounded, eliminated. Tap all untapped allies and characters with a mind stat.
