> > _**Unique.**_ Playable on a Ringwraith at a tapped or untapped Barad-dur (does not tap the site). Your Ringwraith receives +2 prowess. If your Ringwraith is the only creature in his company, the company is in Fell Rider mode and may move freely (using starter movement). Tap this ally to cancel a strike against your Ringwraith or to assign your Ringwraith's strikes against a hero company as you choose before hero strikes are assigned. Return your Ringwraith to your hand if this ally leaves active play.
