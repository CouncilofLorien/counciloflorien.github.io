> > _Dark Enchantment._ Playable on a Dragon or Drake hazard creature attack before the strikes are assigned. For each card you discard from your hand, when Dragon's Terror is declared, target one non-Wizard character of your choice in the defending company and make a roll (or draw a #)-add +2 for a Dragon attack. If the result is greater than the character's mind, the character taps. Each card discarded in this fashion counts as one against the company's hazard limit.
