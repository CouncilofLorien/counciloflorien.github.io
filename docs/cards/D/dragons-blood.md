> > Playable on a character facing a Dragon or Drake strike (before the dice are rolled to resolve the strike). If the strike fails, the target character must make a body check modified by -1 if he has armor, by -1 if he has a shield, and by -1 if he has a helmet. Cannot be duplicated on a given character.  "The enchanted blood of the Great Worms becomes increasingly caustic and corrosive with age." ---Kuduk Lore
