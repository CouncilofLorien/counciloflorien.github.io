In addition, you may discard this card from play during opponent's movement/hazard phase (not counting against the hazard limit) to increase the hazard limit against one company by two. <br>_"The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as easy as it sounded...”_ ***---&#65279;Hob***
