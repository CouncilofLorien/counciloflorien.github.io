 - [FAQ #2 (Dec 1995) - Questions About Specific Cards](/original/rulings/faq-2/#questions-about-specific-cards)<br>**Q:** What do _Great Ship_, _Leaflock_, and _Tom Bombadil_ mean when they say “cancel the effects of one hazard?”<br>**A:** These cards allow the cancelling of an attack. They also allow the cancelling of an ongoing hazard effect that targets the company in question or any entity associated with that company (item, character, site, etc.). They allow the cancelling of a dice-rolling action declared earlier in the same chain of effects but not yet resolved (as in _Call of Home_). They do not allow the cancelling of a non-dice-rolling effect declared earlier in the same chain of effects. For example, they do not allow you to stop _“Tom”_ from forcing a wounded player to discard their item if you passed on the opportunity to cancel _“Tom’s”_ attack. However, once a chain of effects has resolved _Leaflock_ and the others allow the cancelling of an effect of an effect that is ongoing. For example, _Leaflock_ cound stop the effect of _River_, but he could not keep _Adunaphel_ from tapping a character as a short-event.
