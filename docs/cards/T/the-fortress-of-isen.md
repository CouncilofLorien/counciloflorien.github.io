> > _**Unique.**_ May not be a starting stage card. Playable if you are Alatar, Pallando, or Saruman. Playable on Isengard. Isengard is protected. Other Fallen-wizards may not use the Wizardhaven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] card for Isengard. Cards that give marshalling points are not playable at the site by your opponent in all cases. A company moving to or from Isengard is not considered to be moving through Gap of Isen (including one less Border-land \[![](/assets/images/border-land.svg)] in their site path). Discard this card when the site is discarded or returned to its location deck
