> > _Unique._ _May not be a starting stage card._ _Playable if you are Alatar, Pallando, or Saruman._ ***Playable on Isengard.*** Isengard is protected. Other Fallen-wizards may not use the Wizardhaven <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr> card for Isengard. Cards that give marshalling points are not playable at the site by your opponent in all cases. A company moving to or from Isengard is not considered to be moving through Gap of Isen (including one less Border-land <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/border-land.svg">]</nobr> in their site path). Discard this card when the site is discarded or returned to its location deck.
