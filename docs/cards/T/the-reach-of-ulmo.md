> > The roll required to move between adjacent Under-deeps sites is increased by 2. In addition, cancels the effect of Great Ship and Ford. May be played when an Under-deep site is revealed as a new site card (before the roll is made). Discard when any play deck is exhausted or when an Under-deeps site is reached from another Under-deeps site or at the end of the turn after Great Ship or Ford was played. Cannot be duplicated.
