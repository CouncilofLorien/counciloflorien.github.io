> > _**Unique.**_ _Palantir._ ***Playable at Barad-dur.*** When a character taps to play _Ithil-stone_, make a roll (draw a #). If this result plus the number of scouts in his company is greater than 9, _Ithil-stone_ is successfully played. Otherwise, the bearer is eliminated and _Ithil-stone_ is placed in your out-of-play pile. Bearer makes a corruption check at the end of each of his untap phases. _Bane of the Ithil-stone_ is discarded and cannot be played. If _The Lidless Eye_ is in play, its player's hand size decreases by two.
