> > ***Playable on a site with an Orc or Troll automatic-attack.*** When any item is played at this site, the company must face all automatic-attacks of the site again with the attack's prowess modified by +3. Any successful strike does not harm the character, but rather the character is taken prisoner at the site. The rescue-attack equals all automatic-attacks of the site at the time of rescue.
