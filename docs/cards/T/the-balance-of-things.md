 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - TURN SEQUENCE, Site Phase, On-Guard Cards](/original/rulings/crf-1/#on-guard-cards)<br>Additionally, the on-guard card may only be revealed if it affects the company or a character in the company that site phase–this clarification is actually looser than the rule printed on page page 61 of the METW Unlimited Rulesbook. This rule did state the on-guard card may only be revealed if it directly affected the company. Only declared or on-going cards and effects can be considered when determining the validy of revealing an on-guard card–cards in your hand, your opponent’s hand, play deck, discard pile, etc. cannot be considered and potential effects that have not been triggered cannot be considered. An on-guard card may not be revealed if it has an effect that is meaningless during a company’s site phase.<br>As an example of how this requirement is looser now, _Balance of Things_ may be revealed as an on-guard card so long as at least one character in the company, during whose site phase _Balance of Things_ is revealed, carries at least one corruption source.
