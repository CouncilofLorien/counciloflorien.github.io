Discard if attack doesn't wound a character. _Corruption._ One character (attacker's choice) wounded by an attack modified by this card receives 6 corruption points (place this card under the character). If at a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] during his untap phase, a character with this card may attempt to remove it instead of untapping or healing. Make a roll (or draw a #): if this result is greater than 5, discard this card. Cannot be duplicated on a given Nazgul.
