> > ***Playable if Doors of Night is in play on a Nazgul permanent-event that could immediately attack as if it were in your hand as a creature.*** The Nazgul immediately attacks as a creature from its permanent-event state (not counting against the hazard limit) and chooses defending characters. If the Nazgul is defeated, place this card in opponent's marshalling point pile and remove the Nazgul from play. Otherwise, discard this card. This can be used on an opponent's Nazgul permanent-event as well as on your own.
