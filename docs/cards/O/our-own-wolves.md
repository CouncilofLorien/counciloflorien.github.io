> > _Magic._ _Spirit-magic._ ***Playable on a company with a spirit-magic using character facing an attack.*** Each wolf ally (_War-wolf_, _War-warg_, or _The Warg-king_) receives +3 prowess against the attack. Following the attack, the controller of each wolf ally faces an attack: (no type) one strike with the ally's normal prowess +3. If the strike of an attack is successful, discard the wolf ally. Unless he is a Ringwraith, the spirit-magic-using character makes a corruption check modified by -3.
