Any effect that would move him to an untapped state makes him tapped instead. Cannot be duplicated on a given character. <br>&ensp;During the organization phase, a sage in the target character's company may tap to attempt to remove this card. Make a roll (or draw a #): if the result is greater than 7, discard this card.
