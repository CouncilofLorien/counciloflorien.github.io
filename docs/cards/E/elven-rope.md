> > Tap _Elven Rope_ and a ranger bearer during your organization phase to allow his company to move an additional region. <br>&ensp;Instead of eliminating a creature the bearer's company defeated (with a normal prowess less than 11), you may place the creature's card with _Elven Rope_. Discard the creature if _Elven Rope's_ bearer becomes wounded. If stored with a creature, the creature stays with _Elven Rope_ and you receive three miscellaneous marshalling points. Otherwise, the creature has no effect on play.
