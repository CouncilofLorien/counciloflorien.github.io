> > Tap Elven Rope and a ranger bearer during your organization phase to allow his company to move an additional region. Instead of eliminating a creature the bearer's company defeated (with a normal prowess less than 11), you may place the creature's card with Elven Rope. Discard the creature if Elven Rope's bearer becomes wounded. If stored with a creature, the creature stays with Elven Rope and you receive three miscellaneous marshalling points. Otherwise, the creature has no effect on play.
