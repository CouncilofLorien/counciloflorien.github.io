Otherwise, you may tap 1 character in the company and put rescue prisoners under his control. That character may not untap until Rescue Prisoners is stored at a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)], Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)], or Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)] during his organization phase.
