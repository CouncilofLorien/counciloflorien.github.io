> > Unique. Nazgul (8th). May be played as a hazard creature (with one strike) or as a permanent event. As a creature, may also be played keyed to Dagorlad, Ithilien, Gorgoroth, and Horse Plains; and may also be played at sites in these regions. If played as a permanent-event, it will remain in play until tapped during the opponent's movement/hazard phase (tapping counts against the hazard limit). When tapped, Ren the Unclean becomes a short-event; each character in play must make a corruption check.
