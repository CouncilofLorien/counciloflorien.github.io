> > _Balrog specific._ Playable during the site phase on an Under-deeps site normally a Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)] if The Balrog is there. The Balrog's company faces an attack (Drake-2 strikes with 13 prowess). Following the attack, tap the Balrog or discard this card. The associated site is a Darkhaven \[![](/assets/images/dark-haven.svg)] and loses all automatic-attacks. All other versions of this site become a Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] and gain an additional automatic-attack: Orcs-5 strikes with 9 prowess. If Breach the Hold is on the same site, this card gives 3 marshalling points. This site is never discarded or returned to its location deck. Cannot be duplicated on a given site.
