> > _**Unique.**_ _Radagast specific._ ***Playable at one of your Wizardhavens*** <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr>. You may return _Radagast's Black Bird_ to your hand: during your organization phase **or** if its controlling character leaves active play. Radagast may play this ally at any site (tapped or untapped) and need not tap himself or the site to do so. This ally may attempt to influence factions as if he were a character. He may cancel a strike directed against him---tapping afterwards if not already tapped.
