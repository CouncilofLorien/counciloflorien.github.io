> > Playable on a Wizard, Fallen-wizard, or Ringwraith. His prowess and direct influence are each modified by -1. If he is a Fallen-wizard, these modifiers are instead: -5 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 20, -4 if his SPs exceed 15, -3 if his SPs exceed 10, -2 if his SPs exceed 5 (use the first modifier that applies). For Alatar and Radagast, reduce the modifier to 0 for prowess and double it for direct influence. Cannot be duplicated on a given character. Discard when any play deck is exhausted.
