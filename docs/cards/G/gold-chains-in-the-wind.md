> > Magic. Shadow-magic. Playable on a shadow-magic-using character facing an attack before strikes are assigned. An Ally with a prowess of 5 is created which leaves the game when the attack is finished. In all cases, the ally must face one of the attack's strikes. Unless he is a Ringwraith, character makes a corruption check modified by -4.
