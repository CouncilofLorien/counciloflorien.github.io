If you have at least 4 unique Orc and/or Troll factions-none playable at a Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)]-you receive this card's marshalling points. Cannot be duplicated as a permanent-event. Alternatively, as a short-event, you may choose any Orc and Troll factions you're your discard pile and shuffle them into your play deck.
