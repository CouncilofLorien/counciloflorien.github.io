At the end of its movement/hazard phase, target company attempts to move to an additional Under-deeps site which it has not attempted to move to yet this turn. Another site card is played and a movement/hazard phase immediately follows. Return this card to you hand. All hazard creatures the company faces this turn keyed to Shadow-holds \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] attack normally, not as detainment.
