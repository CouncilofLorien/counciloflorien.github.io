> > Playable on a Hobbit facing a strike from an Orc attack. Target Hobbit receives +2 prowess against the strike. If strike is successful, he is not harmed and is taken prisoner at a Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)], Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)], or Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)]. If the Hobbit bears a ring, his player makes a roll at the start of each of his untap phases-if the result is less than 7, discard the ring. Rescue-attacks (3): Orcs-3 strikes with 6 prowess, Orcs-4 strikes with 7 prowess, Orcs-5 strikes with 8 prowess.
