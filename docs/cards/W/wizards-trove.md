Place _Wizard's Trove_ with _The White Tree_---which is worth full marshalling points. Your Wizardhaven <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr> become protected. Ignore the text of _The White Tree_. <br>&ensp;Alternatively, you may store one miscellaneous marshalling point card at one of your Wizardhavens <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr>. Any reference to the site where the card can normally be stored are transferred instead to the Wizardhaven <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr>. Place _Wizard's Trove_ with the stored card---which is worth full marshalling points.
