> > You may play The White Tree at one of your Wizardhavens \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] if Sapling of the White Tree is stored there. Place Wizard's Trove with The White Tree-which is worth full marshalling points. Your Wizardhaven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)] become protected. Ignore the text of The White Tree. Alternatively, you may store one miscellaneous marshalling point card at one of your Wizardhavens \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)]. Any reference to the site where the card can normally be stored are transferred instead to the Wizardhaven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)]. Place Wizard's Trove with the stored card-which is worth full marshalling points.
