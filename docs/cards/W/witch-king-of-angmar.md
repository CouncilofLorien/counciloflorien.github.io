As a creature, may also be played keyed to Angmar, Gundabad, Gorgoroth, and Imlad Morgul; and may also be played at sites in these regions. If played as a permanent-event, it will remain in play until tapped during the opponent's movement/hazard phase (tapping counts against the hazard limit). When tapped, Witch-king of Angmar becomes a short-event and causes all Shadow-holds \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] to become Dark-holds \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)].
