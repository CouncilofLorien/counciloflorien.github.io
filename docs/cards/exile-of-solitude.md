> > One strike of an at home manifestation of any unique Dragon can attempt to capture a non-Wizard character. This strike's prowess is modified by -1. If this strike is successful, it forces the discard of the character (with no body check) and all cards he controls. Alternatively, all strikes of Earcaraxe at Home attempt to capture all non-Wizard characters defending against her strikes.
