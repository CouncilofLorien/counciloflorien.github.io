> > ***Playable on a character during your organization phase.*** One time you may tap your character to place an opponent's character "off to the side" with this card. Do this in lieu of making opponent's character's body check in company vs. company combat with your character's company. Discard all cards on opponent's character. If your character becomes wounded or leaves active play, discard this card---opponent's character then forms a company at your character's current or new site. During the site phase at Shelob's Lair, your character may tap and discard this card to eliminate opponent's character---whom you then receive as kill marshalling points.
