> > As a permanent-event, playable on a face-down agent who was brought into play this turn. When the agent is revealed, and if his home site is a Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)] or a Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)], the site he came into play (which is not represented by a card) may legally be any Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)] or Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)]. Discard when the agent is revealed. Alternatively, as a short-event, take any agent who has a home site that is a Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)] or Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)] from your play deck into your hand (reveal it to your opponent and reshuffle your deck).
