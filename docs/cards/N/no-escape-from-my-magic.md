> > ***Playable on any faction in play.*** On the turns after it is played, this card affects the region that contains the site where this faction is playable and all adjacent regions. Each company moving with region cards using one or more of such regions must make a roll (or draw a #) modified by +2 for each ranger in the company, by +1 for each scout, and by +1 for each diplomat. If the result is 12 or less, the company must do nothing during the site phase. Cannot be duplicated on a given faction.
