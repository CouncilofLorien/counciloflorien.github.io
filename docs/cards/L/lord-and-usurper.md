> > Balrog specific. Playable during the site phase on Invade their Domain. The company faces 2 attacks (Dwarves-4 strikes with 9 prowess, 3 strikes with 10 prowess). Following the attacks, tap a character or discard this card. If this card is not discarded, discard all unique factions playable at the site. All versions of the associated site become a Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)], may have no factions played there, and lose all Dwarf automatic-attacks. Other versions gain an automatic-attack: Orcs-4 strikes with 7 prowess. Cannot be duplicated on a given card.
