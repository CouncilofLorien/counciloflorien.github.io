 - [CRF 1 (Oct 1996) - TURN SEQUENCE, Site Phase, On-Guard Cards](/original/rulings/crf-1/#on-guard-cards)<br>An often confusing point is when and if certain hazards can be revealed as on-guard cards. There are two cases when a face down card may be revealed, and, thusly, affect an opponent’s company: 1) when the company announces it will face a site’s automatic-attacks (before the automatic-attack is itself faced), and 2) when the company plays a card keyed to the site.<br>For case #2, specifically, you may reveal an on-guard card in the same chain of effects in response to the play (declaration thereof) of any item, faction, ally, or other card that potentially taps the site. Successfully testing for and playing a ring special item does not count! You may reveal an on-guard card in response to the declaration of an influence attempt on a faction that only has an effect if the attempt would be successful (e.g., _Lure of Power_). Also, in the case of a faction, you may reveal an on-guard card that affects the actual influence attempt.
