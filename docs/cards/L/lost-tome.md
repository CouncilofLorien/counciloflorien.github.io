After this item is played, the bearer faces an attack (cannot be canceled): Trap-1 strike with 9 prowess (weapons do not modify prowess against this strike). If its bearer is at a Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] or Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)], discard Lost Tome to make information playable at the site until the end of turn.
