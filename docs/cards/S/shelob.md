As a creature, may be played at any site in Imlad Morgul or Gorgoroth. <br>&ensp;If _Doors of Night_ is in play, Shelob may be played as a permanent-event that gives +1 prowess and +1 strikes to all Spider and Animal attacks. She may opt to attack from a permanent-event state and receive these bonuses, but her attack counts as one against the hazard limit. Discard as a permanent event when _Shelob_ attacks or when _Doors of Night_ leaves play.
