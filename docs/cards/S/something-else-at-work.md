If he is a Fallen-wizard, these modifiers are both instead: -4 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 14, -3 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 9, -2 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 4, -1 if his stage points (SPs) exceed 0 (use the first modifier that applies). Cannot be duplicated on a given character. Discard when any play deck is exhausted.
