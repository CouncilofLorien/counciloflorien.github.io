> > Playable during the site phase at an already tapped Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)]. The company faces an attack (attack type as first-automatic-attack at site-3 strikes with 8 prowess). If no characters are untapped after the attack, discard Seize Prisoners. Otherwise, tap 1 character in the company and Seize Prisoners under his control. No marshalling points are received and that character may not untap until Seize Prisoners is stored at a Darkhaven \[![](/assets/images/dark-haven.svg)], Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)], or Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)], during his organization phase. Cannot be duplicated at a given site.
