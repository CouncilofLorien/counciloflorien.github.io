> > ***Playable during the site phase at an already tapped Free-hold*** <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-hold.svg">]</nobr>. The company faces an attack (attack type as first automatic-attack at site---3 strikes with 8 prowess). If no characters are untapped after the attack, discard _Seize Prisoners_. Otherwise, tap 1 character in the company and _Seize Prisoners_ under his control. No marshalling points are received and that character may not untap until _Seize Prisoners_ is stored at a Darkhaven <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr>, Shadow-hold <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg">]</nobr>, or Dark-hold <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/dark-hold.svg">]</nobr>, during his organization phase. Cannot be duplicated at a given site.
