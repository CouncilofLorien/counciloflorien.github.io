> > Playable during the site phase on an untapped scout in a covert company at an already tapped Border-hold \[![](/assets/images/border-hold.svg)] or Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)]. The scout faces an attack (attack type as first automatic-attack at site-1 strike with 8 prowess). If the scout is not untapped after the attack, discard this card. Otherwise, the scout may tap and place this card in his player's marshalling point pile.
