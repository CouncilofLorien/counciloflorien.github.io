Playable on a Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] if one of your scouts is there or on a Ruins & Lairs \[![](/assets/images/ruinlair.svg)] if one of your rangers is there. An automatic-attack is created at the site against minion companies: Orcs-5 strikes with 8 prowess (detainment). Additionally, automatic-attacks at the site are duplicated (including the new one) against all companies. Discard when site is discarded or returned to your location deck.
