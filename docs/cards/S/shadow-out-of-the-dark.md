If agent is revealed and not in a Free-hold \[![](/assets/images/free-hold.svg)] or Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)], he can tap to allow any Undead hazard creatures to be played at his site this turn. Any Undead hazard creature so played do not count against the hazard limit. <br>_"A shadow came out of dark places far away... Barrow-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind."_ ***---&#65279;LotRI***
