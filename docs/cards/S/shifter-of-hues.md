> > _Radagast specific._ _Shapeshifter._ ***Place this card on Radagast if he is in play.*** Return this card to your hand: when you play another Shapeshifter card **or**, if you choose, during your organization phase. In addition to adopting the given attributes, Radagast's skills become Warrior/Diplomat. Radagast may not move. You may keep one more card than normal in your hand. Radagast can tap to give +2 to the corruption checks of the characters in one company through the next organization phase (this company must be moving with at least one Wilderness \[![](/assets/images/wilderness.svg)] in their site path). Radagast may bear, but not use, items.
