Any attempt (by any player) to influence a faction playable at a site in Anorien, Lebennin, Lamedon, Belfalas, or Anfalas is modified by -2 and cannot be attempted with _Muster_. Place any such faction you successfully influence (while this card is in play) under this card. All factions under this card give an additional marshalling point. Discard when any faction under this card is discarded (all other contained factions remain). Cannot be duplicated.
