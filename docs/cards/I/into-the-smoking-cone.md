> > ***Playable on a company with a sage during the site phase at a site where gold ring items are playable.*** Tap this card if the company plays a ring special item; this card never untaps. If this card is tapped, the company can discard (for no effect) a Lost Knowledge card it controls during its site phase at Mount Doom and invert this card on the playing surface (rotate it 180Â°). If inverted, you can store this card at a Haven <nobr>[<img src="/assets/images/free-haven.svg">]</nobr>---only if stored do you receive its marshalling points. If stored, all ring items give one less corruption point. Once inverted, no other copy of this card can be inverted.
