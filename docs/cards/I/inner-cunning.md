> > As a permanent-event, playable on a face-down agent who was brought into play this turn. When the agent is revealed, and if his home site is a Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] or a Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)], the site where he came into play (which is not represented by a card) may legally be any Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] or a Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)]. Discard when the agent is revealed. Alternatively, as  a short-event, take any agent who has a home site that is a Shadow-hold \[![](/assets/images/shadow-hold.svg)] or a Dark-hold \[![](/assets/images/dark-hold.svg)] from your play deck into your hand (reveal it to your opponent and reshuffle your play deck).
