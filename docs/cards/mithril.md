> > Unique. Playable with a Sage or Dwarf only during the site phase at The Under-gates if you have a stored Vein of Arda. Sage or Dwarf may not untap until Mithril is stored at a Haven \[![](/assets/images/free-haven.svg)]. Mithril is worth 7 marshalling points when stored. During any organization phase in which you store Mithril, you may immediately tap a character in the same company and play with him a non-unique, non-special weapon, armor, shield, or helmet from your hand or discard pile. When Mithril is stored, each Dwarf in play must immediately make a corruption check modified by -3.
