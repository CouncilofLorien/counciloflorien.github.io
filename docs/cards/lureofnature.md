{: .counsel }
> The Challenge Deck version does not follow the Unlimited printing or the Limited errata indicating that the checks happen "after all other hazards have been played." It also does not mention that the site path being checked for Wilderness is "at that point in time" ("after all other hazards have been played"). Follows The Lidless Eye version but states that the "Opponent" makes a roll (instead of the character making the roll). This is the "opponent" of the card controller (the owner of the hazard), not the opponent of the player upon whose character the card was played. This version of the art usues the limited/unlimited version but is zoomed in on Radagast and the bird, cutting out a part of the deer's face.

### The Lidless Eye Player Guide

_Lure of Nature_  
_Lure of Nature_ is probably the best corruption card in the game, although _Covetous Thoughts_ is close. However, more companies move than use lots of items. And if a company moves you can almost guarantee they will pass through a Wilderness. It is the most plentiful region on the map, and it is almost impossible to avoid on either side of the Misty Mountains. It works well in either main corruption strategies or as spice in other strategies. One strategy it does not work well with is roadblock. If the company is returned to their site of origin they never have to make the corruption checks.

### Dark Minions Player Guide (1997)

_Lure of Nature_ (errata)&mdash;Replace "at the end of each movement/hazard phase" with "after all other hazards have been played."

\*_Lure of Nature_ (clarification)&mdash;The corruption checks caused by Lure of Nature happen at the end of the afflicted character's movement/hazard phase. Of course, the character's player can play resources to modify the corruption checks. The hazard player is allowed to play hazards in response, if the hazard player has enough hazard limit remaining. Hazards so played must directly affect the corruption checks caused by Lure of Nature. He can play no other hazards, no creature, no new corruption cards, etc. The spirit of Lure of Nature is that the corruption checks will happen after everything else the comany will face.

### The Wizards Player Guide

Though one of ther easiest to remove, _Lure of Nature_ is probably the most effective corruption card in _METW_. It is possible to play this card and force several checks on your opponent's characters the same turn (leaving your opponent very few ways to avoid the checks). Since the corruption checks come during the movement/hazard phase, your opponent's characters could be removed before the site phase (slowing his resource acquisition more). Though _Lure of Nature_ does not affect Hobbits or Dwarves, it does affect Wizards and is very good against Radagast decks. These decks usually seek to maximize the number of Wildernesses they move though. 

### The Wizards Companion (February 1996)

_Lure of Nature_ (errata)&mdash;Replace "&hellip; at the end of each movement/hazard phase &hellip;" with "&hellip; after all other hazards have been played&hellip;"

_Lure of Nature_ (clarification)&mdash;These corruption checks may be targetted at any point during his company's movement/hazard phase.

{: .counsel }
> Normally a card may only be played if it applies to an existing situation. However, there are several special allowances for dice rolls in MECCG. For instance, a dice-roll may be targeted when it is merely declared but not resolved while other actions that are merely declared cannot be targeted. This special rule is needed for dice rolls since dice rolls must be modified before the roll is resolved (the rolling of physical dice by the player). This clarification was issued before the Unlimited card was printed but along with the above errata to the Limited version, which, with the errata, is similar to but not the same as the Unlimited card. However, there seems to be no need for this clarification unless the movement/hazard phase truly is a "procedure" and there was no opportunity to take actions (play a card, tap in support, etc.) after Step 3 (after all other hazards have been played in Step 3) and between Steps 4-6 (which were later conslidated by Annotation 25a in the Lidless Eye Companion).

##### Commentary

Added the keyword _Slayer_ and changed the upper-left marshalling points from 0 to 2, matching the errata.
