_**As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Eldar Days, and was now walking in a world that was no more. In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lórien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world.**_

## INTRODUCTION

The _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_) was first published by Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) in December of 1995. Various sets and expansions were released until ICE lost their license to produce _Lord of the Rings_ games in September of 1999. It allows for creativity, exploration, and competition in Middle-earth that has yet to be replicated by later games. Unfortunately, the _MECCG_ rules often create a sense of confusion and complexity, even where the guidelines are conceptually simple. Even when a rule is known, it may be difficult to track down where it came from. This website provides a complete set of searchable _MECCG_ cards, original rules, and official rulings to aid in such endeavours. Sources and citations are available for the inquisitive.

 - **Cards:** A list of the cards and text in their various published forms along with notes on changes and commentary on play.
 - **Original Rules:** The rulesbooks and rule inserts included with the set and expansion of _MECCG_ along with additional rules and annotations published in the _Companion_ books. 
 - **Official Rulings:** The errata and clarifications to the rules and cards were provided in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) files,  Collected Rulings Files (CRF), and in  various _Companion_ and _Player Guide_ books.  
 - **Tournament Rules:** Regulations for sanctioned tournament under the Council of Lórien, the  sanctioning body of official _MECCG_ tournament play in the United States and Canada under Iron Crown Enterprises. 

### Search Limitations

The search only includes the cards, the original rules, the last collection of rulings (CRF 15), and the last Council of Lórien tournament policy (number 3). Other pages are excluded.
