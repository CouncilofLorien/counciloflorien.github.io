_**As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Eldar Days, and was now walking in a world that was no more. In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lórien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world.**_

## INTRODUCTION

Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) published the rules for playing the _Middle-earth: Collectible Card Game_ (_MECCG_) across various set and expansion rulebooks along with errata & clarifications to the rules and cards. The rules were supplemented by policies for sanctioned tournament games.
 - A rulesbook or rules insert was published along with each set and expansion of _MECCG_. Additional rules and annotations to the rules were published in the _Companion_ books. 
 - Errata and clarifications to the rules and cards were provided in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) files and Collected Rulings Files (CRF). These were published on ICE's website and posted to the rec.games.trading-card.misc newsgroup by the MECCG NetRep. Rulings were also published in the various _Companion_ and _Player Guide_ books.  
 - Rules and regulations for sanctioned tournament play were published in the Council of Lórien Tournament Policies. 

{: .note }
> **Note:** ICE never published a complete and final ruleset as they were developing a second edition of _MECCG_ instead, called "Lord of the Rings Expandable Card Game." LoRE was never released as ICE lost their license to produce Middle-earth games.

### COUNCIL OF LÓRIEN

The Council of Lórien was the sanctioning body of official _MECCG_ tournament play in the United States and Canada.
