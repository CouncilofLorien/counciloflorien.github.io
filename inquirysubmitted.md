_Thank you for your letter. Make for _Lorien_. There I hope we may meet again. If I do not come, Galadriel will advise you. You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, ranger-sage of two prowess and six body, by some called the King's Writer. He knows our business and will help you._

_Yours in haste_

_PS. Do not use It again, not for any reason whatever! Do not travel by night!_
{: .fs-2 .fw-300 .lh-tight }

_PPS. Make sure that it is the real King's Writer. There are many strange men on the roads._

_PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-room: thing wanted always burried. If he forgets I shall roast him._

_Fare Well!_
