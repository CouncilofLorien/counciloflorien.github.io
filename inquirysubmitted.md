_Make for Lorien. There I hope we may meet again. If I do not come, Galadriel will advise you. You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, ranger-sage of two prowess and six body, by some called the King's Writer. He knows our business and will help you._

_PPPS. I hope the webmaster sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-room: thing wanted always burried. If he forgets I shall roast him._
